## Rabbit MQ Support

The biggest feature in this release is ServiceStack's new support for 
[hosting Services via a Rabbit MQ Server](/rabbit-mq),
expanding on our existing [Redis MQ and In Memory messaging](/messaging) options
with a new durable MQ option in the robust and popular [Rabbit MQ](http://www.rabbitmq.com). 
ServiceStack's Rabbit MQ support is available on NuGet with:

    PM> Install-Package ServiceStack.RabbitMq

A new [Rabbit MQ on Windows installation and setup guide](https://github.com/mythz/rabbitmq-windows) was published containing
code samples for working with Rabbit MQ from C#/.NET.

### Configurable Metadata Pages 

New customizable filters were added to the `MetadataFeature` plugin to allow customization of the Master and detail metadata pages before they're rendered.
E.g. you can reverse the order of operation names with:

```csharp
var metadata = (MetadataFeature)Plugins.First(x => x is MetadataFeature);
metadata.IndexPageFilter = page => {
    page.OperationNames.Sort((x,y) => y.CompareTo(x));
};
```

### OrmLite new runtime typed API 

The [IUntypedApi](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.OrmLite/blob/master/src/ServiceStack.OrmLite/IUntypedApi.cs) interface is useful for when you only have access to a late-bound object runtime type which is accessible via `db.CreateTypedApi`, e.g:

```csharp
public class BaseClass
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
}

public class Target : BaseClass
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
}

var row = (BaseClass)new Target { Id = 1, Name = "Foo" };

var useType = row.GetType();
var typedApi = db.CreateTypedApi(useType);

db.DropAndCreateTables(useType);

typedApi.Save(row);

var typedRow = db.SingleById<Target>(1);
typedRow.Name //= Foo

var updateRow = (BaseClass)new Target { Id = 1, Name = "Bar" };

typedApi.Update(updateRow);

typedRow = db.SingleById<Target>(1);
typedRow.Name //= Bar

typedApi.Delete(typedRow, new { Id = 1 });

typedRow = db.SingleById<Target>(1); //= null
```

#### OrmLite Create Table Support

  - Added NonClustered and Clustered options to `[Index]` attribute

## Breaking changes

### Messaging

In order to support Rabbit MQ Server some changes were made to 
[ServiceStack's Messaging API](/messaging) to support all MQ options, namely:

  - `IMessageQueueClient` now exposes high-level `IMessage` API's instead of raw `byte[]`
  - The `IMessage.Error` property is now a `ResponseStatus` type (same used in Web Services)
  - **Ack** / **Nak** APIs were also added to `IMessageQueueClient`
  - All MQ Brokers now have a default `RetryCount=1`

### ServiceStack.Text

  - UrlEncode extension method now encodes spaces with `+` instead of `%20` to match default `HttpUtility.UrlEncode` behavior

### OrmLite

  - MySql and Sqlite providers now treat GUID's as `char(36)`
