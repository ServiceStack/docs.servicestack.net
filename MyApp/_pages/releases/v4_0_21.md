## Authentication

### Windows Auth Provider for ASP.NET

An ASP.NET WindowsAuth Provider preview is available. This essentially wraps the existing Windows Auth support baked into ASP.NET and adds an adapter for [ServiceStack's Multi-Provider Authentication model](/auth/authentication-and-authorization).

It can be registered just like any other Auth Provider, i.e. in the AuthFeature plugin:

```csharp
Plugins.Add(new AuthFeature(
    () => new CustomUserSession(), 
    new IAuthProvider[] {
        new AspNetWindowsAuthProvider(this) { AllowAllWindowsAuthUsers = true }, 
    }
));
```

By default it only allows access to users in `AspNetWindowsAuthProvider.LimitAccessToRoles`, but can be overridden with `AllowAllWindowsAuthUsers=true` to allow access to all Windows Auth users as seen in the example above. 

Credentials can be attached to ServiceStack's Service Clients the same way [as .NET WebRequest's](http://stackoverflow.com/a/3563033/85785) by assingning the `Credentials` property, e.g:

```csharp
var client = new JsonServiceClient(BaseUri) {
    Credentials = CredentialCache.DefaultCredentials,
};

var response = client.Get(new RequiresAuth { Name = "Haz Access!" });
```

To help with debugging, [?debug=requestinfo](/debugging#request-info) has been extended to include the Request's current Logon User info:

> We're interested in hearing future use-cases this can support, feedback on this and future integration with Windows Auth are welcomed on [the Active Directory Integration feature request](http://servicestack.uservoice.com/forums/176786-feature-requests/suggestions/4725924-built-in-active-directory-authentication-suport).

### New GitHub and other OAuth Providers available

Thanks to [Rouslan Grabar](https://github.com/iamruss) we now have a number of new OAuth providers built into ServiceStack, including authentication with GitHub, Russia's most popular search engine [Yandex](http://www.yandex.ru/) and Europe's largest Social Networks after Facebook, [VK](http://vk.com) and [Odnoklassniki](http://odnoklassniki.ru/):

```csharp
Plugins.Add(new AuthFeature(
    () => new CustomUserSession(), 
    new IAuthProvider[] {
        new GithubAuthProvider(appSettings), 
        new YandexAuthProvider(appSettings), 
        new VkAuthProvider(appSettings), 
        new OdnoklassnikiAuthProvider(appSettings), 
    }
));
```

### Extended Auth DTO's

You can now test whether a user is authenticated by calling the Auth Service without any parameters, e.g. `/auth` which will return summary auth info of the currently authenticated user or a `401` if the user is not authenticated. A `DisplayName` property was added to `AuthenticateResponse` to return a friendly name of the currently authenticated user.

## [Portable ServiceStack](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Gap)

A new [ServiceStack.Gap](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Gap) Repository and NuGet package was added to help with creating ServiceStack-powered Desktop applications.

ServiceStack has a number of features that's particularly well-suited for these kind of apps:

 - It allows your services to be self-hosted using .NET's HTTP Listener
 - It supports pre-compiled Razor Views
 - It supports Embedded resources
 - It supports an embedded database in Sqlite and OrmLite
 - It can be ILMerged into a single .exe

Combined together this allows you to encapsulate your ServiceStack application into a single cross-platform .exe that can run on Windows or OSX.

To illustrate the potential of embedded ServiceStack solutions, a portable version [httpbenchmarks.servicestack.net](https://httpbenchmarks.servicestack.net) was created targetting a number of platforms below:

> **[BenchmarksAnalyzer.zip](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Gap/raw/master/deploy/BenchmarksAnalyzer.zip)** - Single .exe that opens the BenchmarksAnalyzer app in the users browser

### Usage

By default `BenchmarksAnalyzer.exe` will scan the directory where it's run from, it also supports being called with the path to `.txt` or `.zip` files to view or even a directory where output files are located. Given this there are a few popular ways to use Benchmarks Analyzer:

 - Drop `BenchmarksAnalyzer.exe` into a directory of benchmark outputs before running it
 - Drop a `.zip` or folder onto the `BenchmarksAnalyzer.exe` to view those results

> Note: It can also be specified as a command-line argument, e.g: "BenchmarksAnalyzer.exe path\to\outputs"

 - [Windows Forms App with Chromium Embedded Framework and CefSharp](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Gap#winforms-with-chromium-embedded-framework)
 - [Mac OSX Cocoa App with Xmarain.Mac](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Gap#mac-osx-cocoa-app-with-xmarainmac)

## Other Framework Features

### Filtering support added to Metadata pages

You can now filter services on ServiceStack's `/metadata` page:

![Metadata Filter](https://github.com/ServiceStack/Assets/raw/master/img/release-notes/metadata-filter.png)

### Typed Request Filters

A more typed API to register Global Request and Response filters per Request DTO Type are available under the `RegisterTyped*` API's in AppHost. These can be used to provide more flexibility in multi-tenant solutions by attaching custom data on incoming requests, e.g:

```csharp
public override void Configure(Container container)
{
    RegisterTypedRequestFilter<Resource>((req, res, dto) =>
    {
        var route = req.GetRoute();
        if (route != null && route.Path == "/tenant/{TenantName}/resource")
        {
            dto.SubResourceName = "CustomResource";
        }
    });
}
```

Typed Filters can also be used to apply custom behavior on Request DTO's sharing a common interface, e.g:

```csharp
public override void Configure(Container container)
{
    RegisterTypedRequestFilter<IHasSharedProperty>((req, res, dtoInterface) => {
        dtoInterface.SharedProperty = "Is Shared";    
    });
}
```

### Buffered Stream option has now added to Response 

Response streams can be buffered in the same way as you can buffer Request streams by setting `UseBufferedStream=true`, e.g:

```csharp
appHost.PreRequestFilters.Add((httpReq, httpRes) => {
    httpReq.UseBufferedStream = true;
    httpRes.UseBufferedStream = true;    
});

```

### AfterInitCallbacks added to AppHost

You can register callbacks to add custom logic straight after the AppHost has finished initializing. E.g. you can find all Roles specified in `[RequiredRole]` attributes with:

```csharp
appHost.AfterInitCallbacks.Add(host =>
{
    var allRoleNames = host.Metadata.OperationsMap
        .SelectMany(x => x.Key.AllAttributes<RequiredRoleAttribute>()
            .Concat(x.Value.ServiceType.AllAttributes<RequiredRoleAttribute>()))
        .SelectMany(x => x.RequiredRoles);
});
```

### Request Scopes can be configured to use ThreadStatic

Request Scoped dependencies are stored in `HttpRequest.Items` for ASP.NET hosts and uses Remoting's `CallContext.LogicalData` API's in self-hosts. Using the Remoting API's can be problematic in old versions of Mono or when executed in test runners.

If this is an issue the RequestContext can be configured to use ThreadStatic with:

```csharp
RequestContext.UseThreadStatic = true;
```

### Logging

Updated Logging providers to allow `debugEnabled` in their LogFactory constructor, e.g:

```csharp
LogFactory.LogManager = new NullLogFactory(debugEnabled:false);
LogFactory.LogManager = new ConsoleLogFactory(debugEnabled:true);
LogFactory.LogManager = new DebugLogFactory(debugEnabled:true);
```

Detailed command logging is now enabled in OrmLite and Redis when `debugEnabled=true`. The external Logging provider NuGet packages have also been updated to use their latest version.

### Razor

 - Enabled support for Razor `@helpers` and `@functions` in Razor Views
 - Direct access to Razor Views in `/Views` is now denied by default

### Service Clients

 - Change Silverlight to auto emulate HTTP Verbs for non GET or POST requests
 - Shorter aliases added on `PostFileWithRequest` which uses the Request DTO's auto-generated url
 - The [PCL version of ServiceStack.Interfaces](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/HelloMobile) now supports a min version of .NET 4.0

## OrmLite

### Exec and Result Filters

A new `CaptureSqlFilter` Results Filter has been added which shows some of the power of OrmLite's Result filters by being able to capture SQL Statements without running them, e.g:

```csharp
public class CaptureSqlFilter : OrmLiteResultsFilter
{
    public CaptureSqlFilter()
    {
        SqlFilter = CaptureSql;
        SqlStatements = new List<string>();
    }

    private void CaptureSql(string sql)
    {
        SqlStatements.Add(sql);
    }

    public List<string> SqlStatements { get; set; }
}
```

This can then be wrapped around existing database calls to capture and print the generated SQL, e.g:

```csharp
using (var captured = new CaptureSqlFilter())
using (var db = OpenDbConnection())
{
    db.CreateTable<Person>();
    db.Count<Person>(x => x.Age < 50);
    db.Insert(new Person { Id = 1, FirstName = "Jimi", LastName = "Hendrix" });
    db.Delete<Person>(new { FirstName = "Jimi", Age = 27 });

    var sql = string.Join(";\n", captured.SqlStatements.ToArray());
    sql.Print();
}
```

#### Exec filters can be limited to specific Dialect Providers

```csharp
OrmLiteConfig.DialectProvider.ExecFilter = execFilter;
```

### OrmLite's custom SqlBuilders now implement ISqlExpression

OrmLite provides good support in integrating with external or custom SQL builders that implement OrmLite's simple `ISqlExpression` interface which can be passed directly to `db.Select()` API. This has now been added to OrmLite's other built-in SQL Builders, e.g:

#### Using JoinSqlBuilder

```csharp
var joinQuery = new JoinSqlBuilder<User, User>()
    .LeftJoin<User, Address>(x => x.Id, x => x.UserId, 
        sourceWhere: x => x.Age > 18, 
        destinationWhere: x => x.Country == "Italy");

var results = db.Select<User>(joinQuery);
```

#### Using SqlBuilder

```csharp
var tmpl = sb.AddTemplate(
    "SELECT * FROM User u INNER JOIN Address a on a.UserId = u.Id /**where**/");
sb.Where("Age > @age", new { age = 18 });
sb.Where("Countryalias = @country", new { country = "Italy" });

var results = db.Select<User>(tmpl, tmpl.Parameters);
```

### Other Changes

 - OrmLite can create tables with any numeric type in all providers. Fallbacks were added on ADO.NET providers that don't support the numeric type natively
 - Load/Save Reference property conventions can be [inferred on either aliases or C# property names](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/main/ServiceStack.OrmLite/tests/ServiceStack.OrmLite.Tests/LoadReferencesTests.cs#L207)
 - OrmLite can create tables from types with Indexers
 - Can use `OrmLiteConfig.StripUpperInLike=true` to [remove use of upper() in Sql Expressions](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/main/ServiceStack.OrmLite/tests/ServiceStack.OrmLite.Tests/Expression/SelectExpressionTests.cs#L205)

## Redis

A new `TrackingRedisClientsManager` client manager has been added by [Thomas James](https://github.com/tvjames) to help diagnose Apps that are leaking redis connections.
