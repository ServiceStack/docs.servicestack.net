![](/img/pages/release-notes/v8.4/bg-sqlite.webp)

We're excited to announce **Background Jobs** our effortless solution for queueing and managing 
background jobs and scheduled tasks in any .NET 8 App, implemented in true ServiceStack fashion
where it seamlessly integrates into existing Apps and call existing APIs and sports a 
[built-in](https://servicestack.net/auto-ui) Management UI to provide real-time monitoring, inspection and management of background jobs.

### Durable and Infrastructure-Free

Prior to Background Jobs we've been using [Background MQ](/background-mq) for executing
our background tasks which lets you queue any Request DTO to execute its API in a background worker.
It's been our preferred choice as it didn't require any infrastructure dependencies since its concurrent
queues are maintained in memory, this also meant they were non-durable that didn't survive across App restarts. 
Whilst [ServiceStack MQ](/messaging) enables an additional endpoint for your APIs our main use-case for using 
it was for executing background tasks which would be better suited by purpose-specific software 
designed for the task.

#### SQLite Persistence

It uses SQLite as the backing store for its durability since it's low latency, 
[fast disk persistence](https://www.sqlite.org/fasterthanfs.html) and embeddable file-based 
database makes it ideally suited for the task which allows creation of naturally partition-able 
and archivable monthly databases on-the-fly without any maintenance overhead or infrastructure 
dependencies making it easy to add to any .NET App without impacting or adding increased load to 
their existing configured databases.

### Queue APIs or Commands

For even greater reuse you're able to queue your existing ServiceStack APIs
as a Background Job in addition to [Commands](/commands) added in the 
[last v8.3 release](/releases/v8_03) for encapsulating units of logic
into internal invokable, inspectable and auto-retryable building blocks.

### Real Time Admin UI

The Background Jobs Admin UI provides a real time view into the status of all background jobs including 
their progress, completion times, Executed, Failed and Cancelled Jobs, etc. which is useful for monitoring 
and debugging purposes.

Please [let us know](https://servicestack.net/ideas) of any other missing features you'd love to see implemented.

## Install

As it's more versatile and better suited, we've replaced the usage of Background MQ with
ServiceStack.Jobs in all **.NET 8 Identity Auth Templates** for sending Identity Auth Confirmation 
Emails when SMTP is enabled. So the easiest way to get started with ServiceStack.Jobs is to 
[create a new Identity Auth Project](https://servicestack.net/start), e.g:

:::sh
x new blazor-vue MyApp
:::

### Exiting .NET 8 Templates

Existing .NET 8 Projects can configure their app to use **ServiceStack.Jobs** by mixing in:

:::sh
x mix jobs
:::

Which adds the `Configure.BackgroundJobs.cs` [Modular Startup](https://docs.servicestack.net/modular-startup)
configuration and a **ServiceStack.Jobs** NuGet package reference to your project.

## Usage

Any API, Controller or Minimal API can execute jobs with the `IBackgroundJobs` dependency, e.g.
here's how you can run a background job to send a new email when an API is called in 
any new Identity Auth template:

```csharp
class MyService(IBackgroundJobs jobs) : Service 
{
    public object Any(MyOrder request)
    {
        var jobRef = jobs.EnqueueCommand<SendEmailCommand>(new SendEmail {
            To = "my@email.com",
            Subject = $"Received New Order {request.Id}",
            BodyText = $"""
                       Order Details:
                       {request.OrderDetails.DumptTable()}
                       """,
        });
        //...
    }
}
```

Which records and immediately executes a worker to execute the `SendEmailCommand` with the specified
`SendEmail` Request argument. It also returns a reference to a Job which can be used later to query
and track execution of a job.

Alternatively a `SendEmail` API could be executed with just the Request DTO: 

```csharp
var jobRef = jobs.EnqueueApi(new SendEmail {
    To = "my@email.com",
    Subject = $"Received New Order {request.Id}",
    BodyText = $"""
               Order Details:
               {request.OrderDetails.DumptTable()}
               """,
});
```

Although Sending Emails is typically not an API you want to make externally available and would 
want to either [Restrict access](/auth/restricting-services) or [limit usage to specified users](/auth/identity-auth#declarative-validation-attributes).

In both cases the `SendEmail` Request is persisted into the Jobs SQLite database for durability 
that gets updated as it progresses through the queue.

For execution the API or command is resolved from the IOC before being invoked with the Request.
APIs are executed via the [MQ Request Pipeline](/order-of-operations)
and commands executed using the [Commands Feature](/commands) where
it will be also visible in the [Commands Admin UI](/commands#command-admin-ui).

### Background Job Options

The behavior for each `Enqueue*` method for executing background jobs can be customized with 
the following options: 

 - `Worker` - Serially process job using a named worker thread 
 - `Callback` - Invoke another command with the result of a successful job 
 - `DependsOn` - Execute jobs after successful completion of a dependent job
   - If parent job fails all dependent jobs are cancelled
 - `UserId` - Execute within an Authenticated User Context
 - `RunAfter` - Queue jobs that are only run after a specified date
 - `RetryLimit` - Override default retry limit for how many attempts should be made to execute a job
 - `TimeoutSecs` - Override default timeout for how long a job should run before being cancelled
 - `RefId` - Allow clients to specify a unique Id (e.g Guid) to track job
 - `Tag` - Group related jobs under a user specified tag
 - `CreatedBy` - Optional field for capturing the owner of a job
 - `BatchId` - Group multiple jobs with the same Id
 - `ReplyTo` - Optional field for capturing where to send notification for completion of a Job
 - `Args` - Optional String Dictionary of Arguments that can be attached to a Job

### Schedule Recurring Tasks

In addition to queueing jobs to run in the background, it also supports scheduling recurring tasks 
to execute APIs or Commands at fixed intervals.

:::youtube DtB8KaXXMCM
Schedule your Reoccurring Tasks with Background Jobs!
:::

APIs and Commands can be scheduled to run at either a `TimeSpan` or
[CRON Expression](https://github.com/HangfireIO/Cronos?tab=readme-ov-file#cron-format) interval, e.g:

```csharp
jobs.RecurringCommand<CheckUrlsCommand>(Schedule.Cron("* * * * *"));
jobs.RecurringCommand<CheckUrlsCommand>(
    Schedule.Interval(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1)));

jobs.RecurringCommand<CheckUrlsCommand>(Schedule.EveryMinute, new CheckUrls {
    Urls = urls
});

jobs.RecurringApi(Schedule.Interval(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1)), new CheckUrls {
    Urls = urls
});
```

That can be registered with an optional **Task Name** and **Background Options**, e.g:

```csharp
jobs.RecurringCommand<CheckUrlsCommand>("Check URLs", Schedule.EveryMinute, 
   new() {
       RunCommand = true // don't persist job
   });
```

:::info
If no name is provided, the Command's Name or APIs Request DTO will be used
:::

Scheduled Tasks are idempotent where the same registration with the same name will
either create or update the scheduled task registration without losing track of the
last time the Recurring Task was run which is also viewable in the Jobs Admin UI:

![](/img/pages/jobs/jobs-scheduled-tasks-last-job.webp)

As such it's recommended to always define your App's Scheduled Tasks on Startup:

### Executing non-durable jobs

`IBackgroundJobs` also supports `RunCommand` methods to be able to execute jobs transiently 
(i.e. non-durable), which is useful for commands that want to be serially executed by a named worker 
but don't need to be persisted.

You could use this to queue system emails to be sent by the same **smtp** worker and are happy to 
avoid tracking its state and execution history in the Jobs database.

```csharp
var job = jobs.RunCommand<SendEmailCommand>(new SendEmail { ... }, 
    new() {
        Worker = "smtp"
    });
```

In this case `RunCommand` returns the actual `BackgroundJob` instance that will be updated by 
the worker. 

You can also use `RunCommandAsync` if you prefer to wait until the job has been executed. Instead
of a Job it returns the **Result** of the command if it returned one. 

```csharp
var result = await jobs.RunCommandAsync<SendEmailCommand>(new SendEmail {...}, 
    new() {
        Worker = "smtp"
    });
```

### Serially Execute Jobs with named Workers

By default jobs are executed immediately in a new Task, we can also change the behavior to
instead execute jobs one-by-one in a serial queue by specifying them to use the same named 
worker as seen in the example above.

Alternatively you can annotate the command with the `[Worker]` attribute if you **always** want 
all jobs executing the command to use the same worker:

```csharp
[Worker("smtp")]
public class SendEmailCommand(IBackgroundJobs jobs) : SyncCommand<SendEmail>
{
    //...
}
```

### Use Callbacks to process the results of Commands

Callbacks can be used to extend the lifetime of a job to include processing a callback to process its results.
This is useful where you would like to reuse the the same command but handle the results differently,
e.g. the same command can email results or invoke a webhook by using a callback:

```csharp
jobs.EnqueueCommand<CheckUrlsCommand>(new CheckUrls { Urls = allUrls },
    new() {
        Callback = nameof(EmailUrlResultsCommand),
    });

jobs.EnqueueCommand<CheckUrlsCommand>(new CheckUrls { Urls = criticalUrls },
    new() {
        Callback = nameof(WebhookUrlResultsCommand),
        ReplyTo = callbackUrl
    });
```

Callbacks that fail are auto-retried the same number of times as their jobs, which if they all fail then 
the entire job is also marked as failed. 

### Run Job dependent on successful completion of parent

Jobs can be queued to only run after the successful completion of another job, this is useful 
for when you need to kick off multiple jobs after a long running task has finished like
generating monthly reports after monthly data has been aggregated, e.g: 

```csharp
var jobRef = jobs.EnqueueCommand<AggregateMonthlyDataCommand>(new Aggregate {
    Month = DateTime.UtcNow
});

jobs.EnqueueCommand<GenerateSalesReportCommand>(new () {
   DependsOn = jobRef.Id,
});

jobs.EnqueueCommand<GenerateExpenseReportCommand>(new () {
   DependsOn = jobRef.Id,
});
```

Inside your command you can get a reference to your current job with `Request.GetBackgroundJob()`
which will have its `ParentId` populated with the parent job Id and `job.ParentJob` containing
a reference to the completed Parent Job where you can access its Request, Results and other job 
information:

```csharp
public class GenerateSalesReportCommand(ILogger<MyCommandNoArgs> log) 
    : SyncCommand
{
    protected override void Run()
    {
        var job = Request.GetBackgroundJob();
        var parentJob = job.ParentJob;
    }
}
```

### Atomic Batching Behavior

We can also use `DependsOn` to implement atomic batching behavior where from inside our
executing command we can queue new jobs that are dependent on the successful execution
of the current job, e.g:

```csharp
public class CheckUrlsCommand(IHttpClientFactory factory, IBackgroundJobs jobs)
    : AsyncCommand<CheckUrls>
{
    protected override async Task RunAsync(CheckUrls req, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        var job = Request.GetBackgroundJob();

        var batchId = Guid.NewGuid().ToString("N");
        using var client = factory.CreateClient();
        foreach (var url in req.Urls)
        {
            var msg = new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Get, url);
            var response = await client.SendAsync(msg, ct);
            response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
      
            jobs.EnqueueCommand<SendEmailCommand>(new SendEmail {
                To = "my@email.com",
                Subject = $"{new Uri(url).Host} status",
                BodyText = $"{url} is up",
            }, new() {
                DependsOn = job.Id,
                BatchId = batchId,
            });
        }
    }
}
```

Where any dependent jobs are only executed if the job was successfully completed. 
If instead an exception was thrown during execution, the job will be failed and
all its dependent jobs cancelled and removed from the queue.

### Executing jobs with an Authenticated User Context

If you have existing logic dependent on a Authenticated `ClaimsPrincipal` or ServiceStack
`IAuthSession` you can have your APIs and Commands also be executed with that user context
by specifying the `UserId` the job should be executed as:

```csharp
var openAiRequest = new CreateOpenAiChat {
   Request = new() {
       Model = "gpt-4",
       Messages = [
           new() {
               Content = request.Question
           }
       ]
   },
}; 

// Example executing API Job with User Context
jobs.EnqueueApi(openAiRequest, 
    new() {
      UserId = Request.GetClaimsPrincipal().GetUserId(),
      CreatedBy = Request.GetClaimsPrincipal().GetUserName(),
   });

// Example executing Command Job with User Context
jobs.EnqueueCommand<CreateOpenAiChatCommand>(openAiRequest, 
    new() {
      UserId = Request.GetClaimsPrincipal().GetUserId(),
      CreatedBy = Request.GetClaimsPrincipal().GetUserName(),
   });
```

Inside your API or Command you access the populated User `ClaimsPrincipal` or
ServiceStack `IAuthSession` using the same APIs that you'd use inside your ServiceStack APIs, e.g:

```csharp
public class CreateOpenAiChatCommand(IBackgroundJobs jobs) 
    : AsyncCommand<CreateOpenAiChat>
{
    protected override async Task RunAsync(
        CreateOpenAiChat request, CancellationToken token)
    {
        var user = Request.GetClaimsPrincipal();
        var session = Request.GetSession();
        //...
    }
}
```

### Queue Job to run after a specified date

Using `RunAfter` lets you queue jobs that are only executed after a specified `DateTime`, 
useful for executing resource intensive tasks at low traffic times, e.g: 

```csharp
var jobRef = jobs.EnqueueCommand<AggregateMonthlyDataCommand>(new Aggregate {
       Month = DateTime.UtcNow
   }, 
   new() {
       RunAfter = DateTime.UtcNow.Date.AddDays(1)
   });
```

### Attach Metadata to Jobs

All above Background Job Options have an effect on when and how Jobs are executed.
There are also a number of properties that can be attached to a Job that can be useful
in background job processing despite not having any effect on how jobs are executed.

These properties can be accessed by commands or APIs executing the Job and are visible
and can be filtered in the Jobs Admin UI to help find and analyze executed jobs.

```csharp
var jobRef = jobs.EnqueueCommand<CreateOpenAiChatCommand>(openAiRequest, 
   new() {
      // Group related jobs under a common tag
      Tag = "ai",
      // A User-specified or system generated unique Id to track the job
      RefId = request.RefId,
      // Capture who created the job
      CreatedBy = Request.GetClaimsPrincipal().GetUserName(),
      // Link jobs together that are sent together in a batch
      BatchId = batchId,
      // Capture where to notify the completion of the job to
      ReplyTo = "https:example.org/callback",
      // Additional properties about the job that aren't in the Request  
      Args = new() {
          ["Additional"] = "Metadata"
      }
   });
```

### Querying a Job

A job can be queried by either it's auto-incrementing `Id` Primary Key or by a unique `RefId`
that can be user-specified.

```csharp
var jobResult = jobs.GetJob(jobRef.Id);

var jobResult = jobs.GetJobByRefId(jobRef.RefId);
```

At a minimum a `JobResult` will contain the Summary Information about a Job as well as the 
full information about a job depending on where it's located:

```csharp
class JobResult
{
    // Summary Metadata about a Job in the JobSummary Table 
    JobSummary Summary
    // Job that's still in the BackgroundJob Queue
    BackgroundJob? Queued
    // Full Job information in Monthly DB CompletedJob Table
    CompletedJob? Completed
    // Full Job information in Monthly DB FailedJob Table
    FailedJob? Failed
    // Helper to access full Job Information
    BackgroundJobBase? Job => Queued ?? Completed ?? Failed 
}
```

### Job Execution Limits

Default Retry and Timeout Limits can be configured on the Backgrounds Job plugin:

```csharp
services.AddPlugin(new BackgroundsJobFeature
{
   DefaultRetryLimit = 2,
   DefaultTimeout = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(10),
});
```

These limits are also overridable on a per-job basis, e.g: 

```csharp
var jobRef = jobs.EnqueueCommand<AggregateMonthlyDataCommand>(new Aggregate {
       Month = DateTime.UtcNow
   }, 
   new() {
      RetryLimit = 3,
      Timeout = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(30),
   });
```

### Logging, Cancellation an Status Updates

We'll use the command for checking multiple URLs to demonstrate some recommended patterns
and how to enlist different job processing features.

```csharp
public class CheckUrlsCommand(
    ILogger<CheckUrlsCommand> logger,
    IBackgroundJobs jobs,
    IHttpClientFactory clientFactory) : AsyncCommand<CheckUrls>
{
    protected override async Task RunAsync(CheckUrls req, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        // 1. Create Logger that Logs and maintains logging in Jobs DB
        var log = Request.CreateJobLogger(jobs,logger);

        // 2. Get Current Executing Job
        var job = Request.GetBackgroundJob();

        var result = new CheckUrlsResult {
            Statuses = new()
        };
        using var client = clientFactory.CreateClient();
        for (var i = 0; i < req.Urls.Count; i++)
        {
            // 3. Stop processing Job if it's been cancelled 
            ct.ThrowIfCancellationRequested();

            var url = req.Urls[i];
            try
            {
                var msg = new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Get,url);
                var response = await client.SendAsync(msg, ct);

                result.Statuses[url] = response.IsSuccessStatusCode;
                log.LogInformation("{Url} is {Status}",
                    url, response.IsSuccessStatusCode ? "up" : "down");

                // 4. Optional: Maintain explicit progress and status updates
                log.UpdateStatus(i/(double)req.Urls.Count,$"Checked {i} URLs");
            }
            catch (Exception e)
            {
                log.LogError(e, "Error checking {Url}", url);
                result.Statuses[url] = false;
            }
        }

        // 5. Send Results to WebHook Callback if specified
        if (job.ReplyTo != null)
        {
            jobs.EnqueueCommand<NotifyCheckUrlsCommand>(result,
                new() {
                    ParentId = job.Id,
                    ReplyTo = job.ReplyTo,
                });
        }
    }
}
```

We'll cover some of the notable parts useful when executing Jobs:

#### 1. Job Logger

We can use a Job logger to enable database logging that can be monitored in real-time in the 
Admin Jobs UI. Creating it with both `BackgroundJobs` and `ILogger` will return a combined 
logger that both Logs to standard output and to the Jobs database:

```csharp
var log = Request.CreateJobLogger(jobs,logger);
```

Or just use `Request.CreateJobLogger(jobs)` to only save logs to the database.

#### 2. Resolve Executing Job

If needed the currently executing job can be accessed with:

```csharp
var job = Request.GetBackgroundJob();
```

Where you'll be able to access all the metadata the jobs were created with including `ReplyTo`
and `Args`.

#### 3. Check if Job has been cancelled

To be able to cancel a long running job you'll need to periodically check if a Cancellation
has been requested and throw a `TaskCanceledException` if it has to short-circuit the command
which can be done with:

```csharp
ct.ThrowIfCancellationRequested();
```

You'll typically want to call this at the start of any loops to prevent it from doing any more work.

#### 4. Optionally record progress and status updates

By default Background Jobs looks at the last API or Command run and worker used to estimate 
the duration and progress for how long a running job will take.

If preferred your command can explicitly set a more precise progress and optional status update
that should be used instead, e.g:

```csharp
log.UpdateStatus(progress:i/(double)req.Urls.Count, $"Checked {i} URLs");
```

Although generally the estimated duration and live logs provide a good indication for the progress
of a job.

#### 5. Notify completion of Job

Calling a Web Hook is a good way to notify externally initiated job requests of the completion
of a job. You could invoke the callback within the command itself but there are a few benefits
to initiating another job to handle the callback:

 - Frees up the named worker immediately to process the next task
 - Callbacks are durable, auto-retried and their success recorded like any job
 - If a callback fails the entire command doesn't need to be re-run again

We can queue a callback with the result by passing through the `ReplyTo` and link it to the
existing job with:

```csharp
if (job.ReplyTo != null)
{
   jobs.EnqueueCommand<NotifyCheckUrlsCommand>(result,
       new() {
           ParentId = job.Id,
           ReplyTo = job.ReplyTo,
       });
}
```

Which we can implement by calling the `SendJsonCallbackAsync` extension method with the
Callback URL and the Result DTO it should be called with:

```csharp
public class NotifyCheckUrlsCommand(IHttpClientFactory clientFactory) 
    : AsyncCommand<CheckUrlsResult>
{
    protected override async Task RunAsync(
        CheckUrlsResult request, CancellationToken token)
    {
        await clientFactory.SendJsonCallbackAsync(
            Request.GetBackgroundJob().ReplyTo, request, token);
    }
}
```

#### Callback URLs

`ReplyTo` can be any URL which by default will have the result POST'ed back to the URL with a JSON
Content-Type. Typically URLs will contain a reference Id so external clients can correlate a callback
with the internal process that initiated the job. If the callback API is publicly available you'll
want to use an internal Id that can't be guessed so the callback can't be spoofed, like a Guid, e.g:

`$"https://api.example.com?refId={RefId}"`

If needed the callback URL can be customized on how the HTTP Request callback is sent.

If the URL contains a space, the text before the space is treated as the HTTP method:

`"PUT https://api.example.com"`

If the auth part contains a colon `:` it's treated as Basic Auth:

`"username:password@https://api.example.com"`

If name starts with `http.` sends a HTTP Header

`"http.X-API-Key:myApiKey@https://api.example.com"`

Otherwise it's sent as a Bearer Token:

`"myToken123@https://api.example.com"`

Bearer Token or HTTP Headers starting with `$` is substituted with Environment Variable if exists:

`"$API_TOKEN@https://api.example.com"`

When needed headers, passwords and tokens can be URL encoded if they contain any delimiter characters.

## Implementing Commands

At a minimum a command need only implement the simple [IAsyncCommand interface](/commands#commands-feature): 

```csharp
public interface IAsyncCommand<in T>
{
    Task ExecuteAsync(T request);
}
```

Which is the singular interface that can execute any command.

However commands executed via Background Jobs have additional context your commands may need to 
access during execution, including the `BackgroundJob` itself, the `CancellationToken` and
an Authenticated User Context.

To reduce the effort in creating commands with a `IRequest` context we've added a number ergonomic 
base classes to better capture the different call-styles a unit of logic can have including 
**Sync** or **Async** execution, whether they require **Input Arguments** or have **Result Outputs**.

Choosing the appropriate Abstract base class benefits from IDE tooling in generating the method
signature that needs to be implemented whilst Async commands with Cancellation Tokens in its method
signature highlights any missing async methods that are called without the token. 

### Sync Commands

 - `SyncCommand` - Requires No Arguments
 - `SyncCommand<TRequest>` - Requires TRequest Argument
 - `SyncCommandWithResult<TResult>` - Requires No Args and returns Result
 - `SyncCommandWithResult<TReq,TResult>` - Requires Arg and returns Result

```csharp
public record MyArgs(int Id);
public record MyResult(string Message);

public class MyCommandNoArgs(ILogger<MyCommandNoArgs> log) : SyncCommand
{
    protected override void Run()
    {
        log.LogInformation("Called with No Args");
    }
}

public class MyCommandArgs(ILogger<MyCommandNoArgs> log) : SyncCommand<MyArgs>
{
    protected override void Run(MyArgs request)
    {
        log.LogInformation("Called with {Id}", request.Id);
    }
}

public class MyCommandWithResult(ILogger<MyCommandNoArgs> log) 
    : SyncCommandWithResult<MyResult>
{
    protected override MyResult Run()
    {
        log.LogInformation("Called with No Args and returns Result");
        return new MyResult("Hello World");
    }
}

public class MyCommandWithArgsAndResult(ILogger<MyCommandNoArgs> log) 
    : SyncCommandWithResult<MyArgs,MyResult>
{
    protected override MyResult Run(MyArgs request)
    {
        log.LogInformation("Called with {Id} and returns Result", request.Id);
        return new MyResult("Hello World");
    }
}
```

### Async Commands

- `AsyncCommand` - Requires No Arguments
- `AsyncCommand<TRequest>` - Requires TRequest Argument
- `AsyncCommandWithResult<TResult>` - Requires No Args and returns Result
- `AsyncCommandWithResult<TReq,TResult>` - Requires Arg and returns Result

```csharp
public class MyAsyncCommandNoArgs(ILogger<MyCommandNoArgs> log) : AsyncCommand
{
    protected override async Task RunAsync(CancellationToken token)
    {
        log.LogInformation("Async called with No Args");
    }
}

public class MyAsyncCommandArgs(ILogger<MyCommandNoArgs> log) 
    : AsyncCommand<MyArgs>
{
    protected override async Task RunAsync(MyArgs request, CancellationToken t)
    {
        log.LogInformation("Async called with {Id}", request.Id);
    }
}

public class MyAsyncCommandWithResult(ILogger<MyCommandNoArgs> log) 
    : AsyncCommandWithResult<MyResult>
{
    protected override async Task<MyResult> RunAsync(CancellationToken token)
    {
        log.LogInformation("Async called with No Args and returns Result");
        return new MyResult("Hello World");
    }
}

public class MyAsyncCommandWithArgsAndResult(ILogger<MyCommandNoArgs> log) 
    : AsyncCommandWithResult<MyArgs,MyResult>
{
    protected override async Task<MyResult> RunAsync(
        MyArgs request, CancellationToken token)
    {
        log.LogInformation("Called with {Id} and returns Result", request.Id);
        return new MyResult("Hello World");
    }
}
```


## SQLite Request Logs

Up until this release all of ServiceStack's database features like [AutoQuery](https://servicestack.net/autoquery)
have been database agnostic courtesy of OrmLite's [support for popular RDBMS's](/ormlite/installation)
so that they integrate into an App's existing configured database.

[Background Jobs](/background-jobs) is our first foray into a SQLite-only backend, as it's the only 
RDBMS that enables us to provide encapsulated black-box functionality without requiring any infrastructure 
dependencies. It's low latency, high-performance and ability to create lightweight databases on the fly make 
it ideal for self-managing isolated appliance backends like Background Jobs and Request Logging which don't 
benefit from integrating with your existing RDBMS.

The new [ServiceStack.Jobs](https://nuget.org/packages/ServiceStack.Jobs) NuGet package allows us
to deliver plug and play SQLite backed features into .NET 8 Apps that are configured with any RDBMS
or without one. The next feature added is a SQLite backed provider for [Request Logs](/request-logger) 
with the new `SqliteRequestLogger` which can be added to existing .NET 8 Apps with the
[mix tool](/mix-tool):

:::sh
x mix sqlitelogs
:::

Which adds a reference to **ServiceStack.Jobs** and the [Modular Startup](/modular-startup) config below:

```csharp
using ServiceStack.Jobs;
using ServiceStack.Web;

[assembly: HostingStartup(typeof(MyApp.ConfigureRequestLogs))]

namespace MyApp;

public class ConfigureRequestLogs : IHostingStartup
{
    public void Configure(IWebHostBuilder builder) => builder
        .ConfigureServices((context, services) => {
            
            services.AddPlugin(new RequestLogsFeature {
                RequestLogger = new SqliteRequestLogger(),
                EnableResponseTracking = true,
                EnableRequestBodyTracking = true,
                EnableErrorTracking = true
            });
            services.AddHostedService<RequestLogsHostedService>();
        });
}

public class RequestLogsHostedService(ILogger<RequestLogsHostedService> log, IRequestLogger requestLogger) : BackgroundService
{
    protected override async Task ExecuteAsync(CancellationToken stoppingToken)
    {
        var dbRequestLogger = (SqliteRequestLogger)requestLogger;
        using var timer = new PeriodicTimer(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(3));
        while (!stoppingToken.IsCancellationRequested && await timer.WaitForNextTickAsync(stoppingToken))
        {
            dbRequestLogger.Tick(log);
        }
    }
}
```

This will use a Hosted Background Service to flush Request Logs to the requests SQLite database 
every **3** seconds (configurable in the PeriodicTimer).

If your App is already using `RequestLogsFeature` configured (e.g. with Profiling) you'll want to
remove it:

```csharp
public class ConfigureProfiling : IHostingStartup
{
    public void Configure(IWebHostBuilder builder) => builder
        .ConfigureServices((context, services) => {
            // services.AddPlugin(new RequestLogsFeature());
            services.AddPlugin(new ProfilingFeature
            {
                IncludeStackTrace = true,
            });
        });
}
```

## Rolling SQLite Databases

The benefit of using SQLite is that databases can be created on-the-fly where Requests will be persisted
into isolated **requests** Monthly databases which can be easily archived into managed file storage instead 
of a singular growing database, visible in the [Database Admin UI](/admin-ui-database):

![](/img/pages/sqlite/sqlite-databases.webp)

SQLite logs will also make it easier to generate monthly aggregate reports to provide key insights
into the usage of your App.

## AutoQuery Grid Admin Logging UI

As SQLite Requests Logs also makes it efficiently possible to sort and filter through logs, the
Logging UI will switch to using a fully queryable `AutoQueryGrid` when using `SqliteRequestLogger`:

![](/img/pages/sqlite/sqlite-request-logs.webp)

## API Keys protected managed File Uploads

The [Managed Files Uploads](/locode/files-overview) feature can now be secured
by [Identity Auth API Key](/auth/apikeys) by setting `requireApiKey:`, e.g:

```csharp
var fileFs = new FileSystemVirtualFiles(context.HostingEnvironment.ContentRootPath);
services.AddPlugin(new FilesUploadFeature(
    new UploadLocation("pub", 
        fileFs,
        readAccessRole: RoleNames.AllowAnon,
        requireApiKey: new(),
        maxFileBytes: 10 * 1024 * 1024,
        resolvePath:ctx => "pub".CombineWith(ctx.Request.GetApiKey().Key, ctx.FileName)),
    new UploadLocation("secure", 
        fileFs,
        requireApiKey: new("manager"),
        maxFileBytes: 10 * 1024 * 1024,
        resolvePath:ctx => "secure".CombineWith(ctx.Request.GetApiKey().Key, ctx.FileName))
));
```

This configuration shows a **pub** upload location allowing for anonymous reads but all writes requiring an API Key. 

The **secure** upload location requires an API key with a **manager** [Scope](/auth/apikeys#scopes) which is required for both read and write access.

In both cases the upload locations will store the files in a sub-directory named after API Key used to upload it.

## HTTP Client Factory HTTP Utils

ServiceStack now registers a named `IHttpClientFactory` that's configured with the same defaults as the built-in [HttpUtils](/http-utils) including using Default Credentials and support for 
Brotli, Deflate and GZip compression.

You can access this via `IHttpClientFactory.HttpUtilsClient()` extension method, e.g:

```csharp
public class MyServices(IHttpClientFactory clientFactory) : Service
{
    public async Task<object> Any(MyRequest request)
    {
        using HttpClient client = clientFactory.HttpUtilsClient();
        //...
    }
}
```

## Scalable SQLite

Ever since adding [support for Litestream](/ormlite/litestream) in
our project's templates [GitHub Action Deployments](https://servicestack.net/posts/kubernetes_not_required)
we've been using SQLite as the backend for our new .NET Apps as it's the 
[most cost-effective option](/ormlite/litestream#savings-at-scale)
that frees us from needing to use a cloud managed database which lets us make use of Hetzner's much cheaper
[US Cloud VMs](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud/).

We're also seeing increased usage of SQLite Server Apps with [Bluesky Social](https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/pull/1705)
having moved to SQLite and all of 37 Signals new [Once](https://once.com) Web Apps 
[using SQLite](https://world.hey.com/dhh/multi-tenancy-is-what-s-hard-about-scaling-web-services-dd1e0e81)
and Cloud Providers building distributed databases on top of SQLite like 
[Cloudflare D1](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-d1/) and Fly.io's 
multi-region distributed [LiteFS](https://fly.io/docs/litefs/) solution.

SQLite is highly-performant and can handle a large number of concurrent read operations and its
write operations are roughly [35% Faster](https://www.sqlite.org/fasterthanfs.html)
than writing to the Filesystem directly with very low latency that's often faster than other RDBMS's
courtesy of its proximity to the running application.

## Single Concurrent Writer

The primary limitation of SQLite is that it only supports a single concurrent writer, which means if you 
have multiple requests writing to the same database at the same time, they will need to coordinate access. 

As long as we can overcome this limitation SQLite can be an excellent choice to power many Web Apps. In the
previous ServiceStack v8.3 release we [worked around this limitation](/commands#use-case-sqlite-writes)
by using [MQ Command DTOs](/commands#mq-command-dtos) to route all DB
Writes to be executed by a single Background MQ Thread.

This works great for [messaging-based architectures](/commands#messaging)
where you can queue commands to be processed serially, but the overhead of using commands for all 
DB writes can be cumbersome when needing to perform sporadic writes within complex logic.

## Multiple SQLite Databases

Firstly a great way to reduce contention is to use separate SQLite databases for different
subsystems of your Application that way load is distributed across multiple DBs
and writes across each SQLite database can be executed concurrently.

This is especially important for write heavy operations like
[SQLite Request Logging](/sqlite-request-logs) or if your App stores every interaction 
of your App for A/B testing, storing them in separate `analytics.db` databases will remove 
any contention from your primary database.

The other techniques below demonstrates concurrent safe techniques for accessing an SQLite DB: 

### Always use Synchronous APIs for SQLite

Generally it's recommended to use non-blocking Async APIs for any I/O Operations however as
SQLite doesn't make Network I/O requests and its native implementation is blocking, its Async DB
APIs are just pseudo-async wrappers around SQLite's blocking APIs which just adds unnecessary
overhead. For this reason we recommend **always** using synchronous APIs for SQLite, especially 
as it's not possible to await inside a lock:

```csharp
lock (Locks.AppDb)
{
    //Can't await inside a lock
    //await Db.UpdateAsync(row); 
    Db.Update(row);
}
```

It's also safe to assume SQLite will always block since all
[Asynchronous I/O efforts](https://www.sqlite.org/asyncvfs.html) were abandoned in favor
of [WAL mode](https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html) which mitigates the cost of blocking **fsync()**.

## Database Locks

The new `Locks` class maintains an object lock for each registered database connection that can be 
used to synchronize **write access** for different SQLite databases, e.g:

```js
var row = db.SingleById<Table>(request.Id);
row.PopulateWithNonDefaultValues(request);
lock (Locks.AppDb)
{
    Db.Update(row);
}
```

`Locks.AppDb` can be used synchronize db writes for the App's primary database, e.g. `App_Data/app.db`.

Whilst `Locks.GetDbLock(namedConnection)` can be used to get the DB Write Lock for any other 
[registered SQLite Database](/ormlite/multi-database-app) by using
the same named connection the SQLite Database Connection was registered against, e.g:

```csharp
var dbFactory = new OrmLiteConnectionFactory(connStr, SqliteDialect.Provider);
dbFactory.RegisterConnection(Databases.Search, 
    $"DataSource=App_Data/search.db;Cache=Shared", SqliteDialect.Provider);
dbFactory.RegisterConnection(Databases.Analytics, 
    $"DataSource=App_Data/analytics.db;Cache=Shared", SqliteDialect.Provider);

//...
using var dbSearch = dbFactory.Open(Database.Search);
locks (Locks.GetDbLock(Database.Search))
{
    dbSearch.Insert(row);
}

using var dbAnalytics = dbFactory.Open(Database.Analytics);
locks (Locks.GetDbLock(Database.Analytics))
{
    dbAnalytics.Insert(row);
}
```

## Queuing DB Writes with SyncCommand

`Locks` are a great option for synchronizing DB Writes that need to be executed within
complex logic blocks, however locks can cause contention in highly concurrent Apps.
One way to remove contention is to serially execute DB Writes instead which we can
do by executing DB Writes within `SyncCommand*` commands and using a named `[Worker(Workers.AppDb)]`
attribute for Writes to the primary database, e.g: 

```csharp
[Worker(Workers.AppDb)]
public class DeleteCreativeCommand(IDbConnection db) 
    : SyncCommand<DeleteCreative>
{
    protected override void Run(DeleteCreative request)
    {
        var artifactIds = request.ArtifactIds;
        db.Delete<AlbumArtifact>(x => artifactIds.Contains(x.ArtifactId));
        db.Delete<ArtifactReport>(x => artifactIds.Contains(x.ArtifactId));
        db.Delete<ArtifactLike>(x => artifactIds.Contains(x.ArtifactId));
        db.Delete<Artifact>(x => x.CreativeId == request.Id);
        db.Delete<CreativeArtist>(x => x.CreativeId == request.Id);
        db.Delete<CreativeModifier>(x => x.CreativeId == request.Id);
        db.Delete<Creative>(x => x.Id == request.Id);
    }
}
```

Other databases should use its named connection for its named worker, e.g: 

```csharp
[Worker(Databases.Search)]
public class DeleteSearchCommand(IDbConnectionFactory dbFactory) 
    : SyncCommand<DeleteSearch>
{
    protected override void Run(DeleteSearch request)
    {
        using var db = dbFactory.Open(Databases.Search);
        db.DeleteById<ArtifactFts>(request.Id);
        //...
    }
}
```

Where it will be executed within its Database Lock. 

## Executing Commands

Now everytime the commands are executed they will be added to a ConcurrentQueue
where they'll be serially executed by the worker's Background Task: 

```csharp
public class MyServices(IBackgroundJobs jobs) : Service
{
    public void Any(DeleteCreative request)
    {
        // Queues a durable job to execute the command with the named worker
        var jobRef = jobs.EnqueueCommand<DeleteCreativeCommand>(request);
        // Returns immediately with a reference to the Background Job
    }

    public async Task Any(DeleteSearch request)
    {
        // Executes a transient (i.e. non-durable) job with the named worker
        var result = await jobs.RunCommandAsync<DeleteSearchCommand>(request);
        // Returns after the command is executed with its result (if any)
    }
}
```

When using any `SyncCommand*` base class, its execution still uses database locks
but any contention is alleviated as they're executed serially by a single worker thread.

### AutoQuery Crud Database Write Locks

To avoid SQLite concurrency write exceptions all DB Writes should be executed within
its database lock or a named worker. Including the auto-generated [AutoQuery Crud](/autoquery/crud)
APIs which will implicitly use Database Locks if the **primary database is SQLite**.

AutoQuery CRUD can also be explicitly configured to always be executed within Database Locks with:

```csharp
services.AddPlugin(new AutoQueryFeature {
    UseDatabaseWriteLocks = true
});
```

## SQLite Web Apps

That's about it, by using any of the above techniques to guard against concurrent writes
you can take advantage of the [simplicity, value and performance benefits](/ormlite/litestream#the-right-time-for-server-side-sqlite)
of SQLite in your Apps and utilize a solution like [litestream.io](https://litestream.io)
for real-time replication of your SQLite databases to highly reliable managed storage.

SQLite's [Checklist For Choosing The Right Database Engine](https://www.sqlite.org/whentouse.html#checklist_for_choosing_the_right_database_engine)
covers the few situations when a traditional Client/Server RDBMS will be more appropriate.

The primary use-case would be when your App needs to be distributed across multiple App Servers 
as using SQLite essentially forces you into scaling up, which gets more appealing every year 
with hardware getting cheaper and faster and cheap hosting providers like [hetzner.com](https://www.hetzner.com)
where you can get bare metal 48 Core/96 vCore EPYC Servers with fast NVMe SSDs for **€236** per month - 
a fraction of the cost of comparable performance with any cloud managed solution

[![](/img/pages/sqlite/hetzner-epyc-48.webp)](https://www.hetzner.com/dedicated-rootserver/)

Which is a fraction of what it would cost for comparable performance using cloud managed databases:

[![](/img/pages/sqlite/azure-sql-database.webp)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/azure-sql-database/single/)

In the rare cases where you need to scale beyond a single server you'll initially be able to 
scale out your different App databases onto different servers.

Beyond that, if your App permits you may be able to adopt a multi-tenant architecture like 
[Bluesky Social](https://bsky.social/about) with each tenant having their own SQLite database 
to effectively enable infinite scaling.

## Example SQLite Apps

Our confidence in SQLite being the best choice for many web applications has led us to adopt
it to power our latest web applications which are all 
[deployed to a shared Hetzner VM](https://servicestack.net/posts/kubernetes_not_required) 
whose [inexpensive hosting costs](https://servicestack.net/posts/jamstacks_hosting) allows us to host 
and make them **available for free!**

All projects are open-source and employ the different techniques detailed above that should serve
as a great resource of how they're used in real-world Web Applications:

### Blazor Diffusion

Generate images for free using custom [Civit AI](https://civitai.com) and [FLUX-schnell](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell)
models:

- GitHub: [github.com/NetCoreApps/BlazorDiffusionVue](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/BlazorDiffusionVue/)

### pvq.app

An OSS alternative to StackOverflow which uses the best proprietary and OSS Large Language Models 
to answer your technical questions. [pvq.app](https://pvq.app) is populated with over **1M+ answers** for the highest rated StackOverflow questions - checkout [pvq.app/leaderboard](https://pvq.app/leaderboard) 
to find the best performing LLM models (results are surprising!)

- GitHub: [github.com/ServiceStack/pvq.app](https://github.com/ServiceStack/pvq.app)

### AI Server

The independent Microservice used to provide all AI Features used by the above applications. 
It's already been used to execute millions of LLM and Comfy UI Requests to generate Open AI Chat Answers
and Generated Images used to populate the
[blazordiffusion.com](https://blazordiffusion.com) and [pvq.app](https://pvq.app) websites. 

It was the project used to develop and test [Background Jobs](/background-jobs) in action 
where it serves as a private gateway to process all LLM, AI and image transformations requests 
that any of our Apps need where it dynamically delegates requests across multiple Ollama, 
Open AI Chat, LLM Gateway, Comfy UI, Whisper and ffmpeg providers. 

[![](/img/pages/sqlite/ai-server.webp)](https://openai.servicestack.net)

- Website: [openai.servicestack.net](https://openai.servicestack.net)
- GitHub: [github.com/ServiceStack/ai-server](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ai-server)

In addition to maintaining a history of AI Requests, it also provides file storage
for its CDN-hostable AI generated assets and on-the-fly, cacheable image transformations.

### Private AI Gateway

We're developing AI Server as a **Free OSS Product** that runs as a single Docker Container
Microservice that Admins can use its built-in UIs to add multiple Ollama instances, 
Open AI Gateways to execute LLM requests and Client Docker agents installed with Comfy UI, 
ffmpeg and Whisper to handle all other non-LLM Requests. 

#### Multiple Ollama, Open AI Gateway and Comfy UI Agents

The AI Server Docker container itself wont require any infrastructure dependencies or 
specific hardware requirements, however any Ollama endpoints or Docker Comfy UI Agents added 
will need to run on GPU-equipped servers.

#### Native end-to-end Typed Integrations to most popular languages

ServiceStack's [Add ServiceStack Reference](/add-servicestack-reference)
feature is used to provide native typed integrations to C#, TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, PHP, Swift, Java, 
Kotlin, Dart, F# and VB.NET projects which organizations can drop into their heterogeneous
environments to manage their private AI Services used across their different Apps.

#### Protected Access with API Keys

AI Server utilizes [Simple Auth with API Keys](/auth/admin-apikeys)
letting Admins create and distribute API Keys to only allow authorized clients to access their 
AI Server's APIs, which can be optionally further restricted to only
[allow access to specific APIs](/auth/apikeys#creating-user-api-keys).

## Active Development

AI Server is still actively developed whilst we finish adding support for different 
AI Requests in its first V1 release, including:

#### Large Language Models
- Open AI Chat
  - Support for Ollama endpoints 
  - Support for Open Router, Open AI, Mistral AI, Google and Groq API Gateways

#### Comfy UI Agent / Replicate / DALL-E 3
- Text to Image

#### Comfy UI Agent
- Image to Image
  - Image Upscaling
  - Image with Mask
- Image to Text
- Text to Audio
- Text to Speech
- Speech to Text

#### ffmpeg 
- image/video/audio format conversions
- image/video scaling
- image/video cropping
- image/video watermarking
- video trimming

#### Managed File Storage
- Blob Storage - isolated and restricted by API Key

### V1 Release

We'll announce **V1** after we've finished implementing the above AI Features with any
necessary Admin UIs, feature documentation / API Docs and have streamlined the 
Server Install / Client Setup experience. After V1 we'll be happy to start accepting 
any external contributions for other AI Features users would like AI Server to support.
