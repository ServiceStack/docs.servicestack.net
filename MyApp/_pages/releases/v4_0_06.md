## Portable Class Library Clients!

The biggest feature of this release is the release of the new Portable Client NuGet packages:

[![Portable Class Library Support](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/Assets/master/img/release-notes/hello-pcl.png)](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/HelloMobile)

  - ServiceStack.Interfaces.Pcl
    - PCL Profiles: iOS, Android, Windows8, .NET 4.5, Silverlight5, WP8
  - ServiceStack.Client.Pcl
    - PCL Profiles: iOS, Android, Windows8, .NET 4.5
    - Custom builds: Silverlight 5
  - ServiceStack.Text.Pcl
    - PCL Profiles: iOS, Android, Windows8, .NET 4.5
    - Custom builds: Silverlight 5

This now allows sharing binaries between the above platforms. To illustrate this a new [Hello Repository](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/HelloMobile) was created to show how to use the same portable class libraries and DTO's across the different client platforms above.

#### Breaking Changes

Adding PCL support to the client libraries involved a lot of internal re-factoring which caused a few external user-facing changes:

  - The `IDbConnectionFactory` and `IHasDbConnection` interfaces referencing System.Data was moved to ServiceStack.Common
  - Properties exposing the concrete `NameValueCollection` are now behind an `INameValueCollection` interface
  - Dynamic classes like `DynamicJson` have been moved under the `ServiceStack` namespace

### Improved SOAP Support 

For maximum compatibility with different SOAP clients, SOAP Exceptions are now treated as "Soft HTTP Errors" where exceptions
are automatically converted to a **200 OK** but returns the original Status Code in the `X-Status` HTTP Response header or `X-Status` SOAP Header.

Errors can be detected by looking at the X-Status headers or by checking the **ResponseStatus.ErrorCode** property on the Response DTO. 
This is transparently handled in ServiceStack's built-in SoapClients which automatically converts Response Errors into populated 
C# WebServiceExceptions, retaining the same behavior of ServiceStack's other typed clients, as seen in 
[WebServicesTests](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/tests/ServiceStack.WebHost.Endpoints.Tests/AlwaysThrowsService.cs#L162).

IHttpRequest.OperationName now reports the Request DTO name for SOAP requests as well, which it gets from the SOAPAction HTTP Header in SOAP 1.1 requests or the **Action** SOAP Header for SOAP 1.2 Requests.
