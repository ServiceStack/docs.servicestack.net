## .NET 8

We're excited to welcome the next major release of ServiceStack v8, designed to take advantage of many advancements
for in .NET's latest long-term release: [.NET 8](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-dotnet-8/) - reflected in the new **v8** major version which identifies
that latest LTS release of .NET that's targeted.

### All NuGet Packages include net8.0 builds

All of ServiceStack's active NuGet packages now include `.net8.0` target framework builds along with their 
dependencies on Microsoft's packages upgraded to use the latest `8.0.0` that were released with .NET 8.

### All .NET Project Templates upgraded to .NET 8

In addition all of ServiceStack's [.NET project templates](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/) have been upgraded to 
use ServiceStack v8 and .NET 8 target framework, in addition the built-in CI/CD deployment GitHub Actions have been
upgraded to use the [secure rootless Linux Docker containers](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/securing-containers-with-rootless/)
that's now built into .NET 8 which allow you to effortlessly deploy your containerized .NET 8 Apps with Docker and

### .NET 8 Docker Containerization

.NET 8 simplifies Docker integration using functionality built into the .NET SDK tooling where it's able to use `dotnet publish` 
to publish your .NET 8 App to a container image without a Dockerfile, adhering to the latest Least privilege and hardened security 
best practices of running App's as non-root by default.

This **publish to container** feature also supports creating Docker images for different architectures like ARM64 which 
sees [significant improvements in .NET 8](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/this-arm64-performance-in-dotnet-8/)
making deploying your .NET Apps to ARM64 an [even better value proposition](https://servicestack.net/posts/cloud-value-between-architectures).

## New .NET 8 Blazor Template

Perhaps the feature we're most excited about are the advancements made to Blazor in .NET 8 which we believe is a game changing
release for .NET Web Development as it's now become suitable for building any kind of Web App in .NET.

The best way to find out what's new in .NET 8 Blazor is to watch the excellent
[Full stack web UI with Blazor in .NET 8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QD2-DwuOfKM) presentation by Daniel Roth and Steve Sanderson,
which covers how Blazor has become a Full Stack UI Web Technology for developing any kind of .NET Web App.

<div class="flex justify-center">
    <lite-youtube class="w-full mx-4 my-4" width="560" height="315" videoid="YwZdtLEtROA" style="background-image: url('https://img.youtube.com/vi/YwZdtLEtROA/maxresdefault.jpg')"></lite-youtube>
</div>

ServiceStack's new [Blazor](https://blazor.web-templates.io) project template takes advantage of .NET 8 Blazor's new features 
that redefines modern Web Development in C# which we explore in this video overview, covering how the template adopts Blazor's 
familiar **ASP.NET Core Identity** and **Entity Framework** for its authentication, utilizes the modern 
[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) framework for beautiful responsive design and adopts .NET's best-practice
[Docker Containerization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/docker/publish-as-container) support for its built-in
[GitHub Action Deployments](https://blazor.web-templates.io/deploy) - enabling a simple ready-made CI solution for deployment to any
Linux Host via SSH and Docker compose.

We’ll also discuss the project's structure, usage of **ASP.NET Core Identity** for Authorization and utilizing
**ServiceStack Blazor Components** for data handling, all integrated to maximize developer efficiency in building Web Applications.

## ASP.NET Core Identity Integration

In terms of security, the template integrates ASP.NET Core Identity, offering a structured approach to authentication,
including support for email confirmation, two-factor authentication and GDPR compliance features.

Integrating ASP.NET Core Identity doesn't complicate securing ServiceStack services which can still be secured with
[Declarative Validation Attributes](/auth/authentication-and-authorization#declarative-validation-attributes)
for role-based access control, e.g. using `[ValidateHasRole("Employee")]` directly on Request DTOs, bringing any
existing knowledge and experience with ServiceStack Authentication to securing UIs and APIs with Identity Auth.

The template includes a pre-baked solution for sending general and Identity Auth Emails with your configured SMTP Server
in managed background workers with [Background MQ](/background-mq) and an enhanced version of the default
ASP.NET Core Blazor Identity UI, with all pages upgraded to use a beautiful Tailwind CSS theme as well as integration with
[qrcode.js](https://davidshimjs.github.io/qrcodejs/)
for providing a visual QR Code barcode which mobile phone users can easily scan to setup 2FA Authentication.

## Responsive and Interactive UIs with Tailwind CSS

With responsive UI out-of-the-box, thanks to Tailwind CSS, Developers can style their Blazor Apps with the modern
popular utility-first CSS framework for creating beautiful, maintainable **Responsive UIs** with **DarkMode** support

It also takes full advantage of Blazor’s static rendering for its Website layout for optimal performance and SEO,
so only Pages and Components that require interactivity need to opt-in for Blazor Server Interactive rendering modes.

## ServiceStack.Blazor Tailwind Components

The [ServiceStack.Blazor Components](https://blazor-gallery.jamstacks.net), updated for .NET 8 enables you to rapidly
develop beautiful Blazor Apps integrated with Rich high-productivity UI Tailwind Components like
[AutoQueryGrid](https://blazor-gallery.servicestack.net/gallery/autoquerygrid) and
[AutoForms](https://blazor-gallery.servicestack.net/gallery/autoform) which interface with
[AutoQuery services](/autoquery/) to provide a full CRUD data management UI with minimal effort.

## Other Template Features

Other features that enhances the default ASP.NET Blazor App templates with several modern, high-productivity features, include:

- [Entity Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/) & [OrmLite](/ormlite/) - Choose the best ORM for each App feature, with a unified solution that sees [OrmLite's DB Migrations](/ormlite/db-migrations) run both EF and OrmLite migrations, inc. Seed Data with a single command at Development or Deployment
- [SQLite Database](https://www.sqlite.org) - Set up as the default database, it allows developers to start immediately without configuring a separate database server
- [AutoQuery](/autoquery/) - Rapidly developing data-driven APIs, UIs and CRUD Apps
- [Auto Admin Pages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt0ytzVVjEY) - Quickly develop your back-office CRUD Admin UIs to manage your App's Database tables at [/admin](https://blazor.web-templates.io/admin)
- [Markdown](/razor-press/syntax) - Maintain SEO-friendly documentation and content-rich pages like this one with just Markdown, beautifully styled with [@tailwindcss/typography](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin)
- [Built-in UIs](https://servicestack.net/auto-ui) - Use ServiceStack's Auto UIs to [Explore your APIs](/api-explorer) at [/ui](https://blazor.web-templates.io/ui/)
  or Query your [App's Database Tables](/admin-ui-database) at [/admin-ui/database](https://blazor.web-templates.io/admin-ui/database)
- [Universal API Components](https://youtu.be/66DgLHExC9E) - Effortlessly create reusable, maximally performant universal Blazor API Components that works in Blazor Server and Web Assembly Interactivity modes
- [Organized Project Structure](/physical-project-structure) - Divided into AppHost, Service Interface, Service Model, and Tests projects to promote separation of concerns and maintainability.

## Your first .NET 8 Blazor App

You won't get to appreciate the sum of Blazor's improvements until you create your first .NET 8 Blazor App where you'll be 
pleasantly surprised that Blazor Apps render fast, clean HTML without needing to load large Web Assembly assets needed for
Blazor WebAssembly Apps or starting a stateful Web Socket connection required for Blazor Server Interactive Apps.

### Static Rendering is now the default

This is because the **default rendering mode** for Blazor uses neither of these technologies, instead it returns to
traditional Web App development where Blazor Pages now return clean, glorious HTML - courtesy of Blazor's
[Static render mode](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/components/render-modes).

[![](/img/pages/release-notes/v8/blazor-ssr.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/components/render-modes)

## Choose your compromise

Previously we were forced to choose upfront whether we wanted to build a Blazor Web Assembly App or a Blazor Server App and
the compromises that came with them, which for public Internet Web Apps wasn't even a choice as Blazor Server Apps perform poorly
over high latency Internet connections.

This meant choosing Blazor Web Assembly which required downloading a large WASM runtime with users experiencing a long 
delay before the App was functional. To minimize this impact our Blazor WebAssembly Tailwind template included 
[built-in prerendering](https://github.com/LegacyTemplates/blazor-tailwind/blob/main/MyApp.Client/wwwroot/content/prerender.md) where as part of deployment would
generate **static .html pages** that were deployed with the Blazor Web Assembly front-end UI that can be hosted on CDN
edge networks to further improve load times.

Whilst this meant the App's UI would be rendered immediately, it still wouldn't be functional until the Web Assembly runtime was
downloaded and initialized, which would flicker as the static UI was replaced with Blazor's WASM rendered UI, then later
Authenticated users would experience further delay and UI jank whilst the App signs in the Authenticated User.
Whilst prerendering is an improvement over the default blank loading screen, it's still not ideal for Internet hosted Apps.

## .NET 8 Blazor is a Game Changer

The situation has greatly improved in .NET 8 where your entire App no longer needs to be bound to a single Interactivity mode.
Even better, Blazor's default **static rendering** mode results in the best UX where the Website Layout and important
landing pages can be rendered instantly.

### Interactive only when you need it

Only pages that need Blazor's interactivity features can opt-in to whichever Blazor interactive rendering mode makes
the most sense, either on a page-by-page or component basis, or by choosing `RenderMode.InteractiveAuto` which uses
**InteractiveWebAssembly** if the WASM runtime is loaded or **InteractiveServer** if it isn't.

### Enhanced Navigation FTW

Ultimately we expect Blazor's new **Enhanced Navigation** will likely be the feature that delivers the best UX gains
users will experience given it's enabled by default and gives traditional statically rendered Web Apps instant SPA-like
navigation responsiveness where new pages are swapped in without needing to perform expensive full page reloads.

It's beauty lies in being able to do this as a mostly transparent detail without the traditional SPA complexity of needing
to manage complex state or client-side routing. It's a smart implementation that's able to perform fine-grained
DOM updates to only parts of pages that have changed, providing the ultimate UX of preserving page state,
like populated form fields and scroll position, to deliver a fast and responsive UX that previously wasn't attainable
from the simplicity of a Server Rendered App.

### Full Stack Web UI

Blazor's static rendering with enhanced navigation and its opt-in flexibility makes .NET 8 Blazor a game changer,
expanding it from a very niche set of use-cases that weren't too adversely affected by its Interactivity mode downsides,
to becoming a viable solution for developing any kind of .NET Web App, especially as it can also be utilized within
existing ASP.NET MVC and Razor Pages Apps.

### Benefits over MVC and Razor Pages

In addition, Blazor's superior component model allows building better encapsulated, more reusable and easier-to-use UI components
which has enabled Blazor's rich 3rd Party library ecosystem to flourish, that we ourselves utilize to develop
the high productivity Tailwind Components in the [ServiceStack.Blazor](https://blazor-gallery.servicestack.net) component library.

So far there's only upsides for .NET Web App development, the compromises only kick in when you need Blazor's interactivity features,
luckily these can now be scoped to just the Pages and Components that need them. But how often do we need them?

### When do you need Blazor's Interactivity features?

It ultimately depends on what App your building, but a lot of Websites can happily display dynamic content, navigate quickly
with enhanced navigation, fill out and submit forms - all in Blazor's default static rendering mode.

Not even advanced features like **Streaming Rendering** used in Blazor Template's
[Weather.razor](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/v8.0.0/src/ProjectTemplates/Web.ProjectTemplates/content/BlazorWeb-CSharp/BlazorWeb-CSharp/Components/Pages/Weather.razor)
page require interactivity, as its progressive rendered UI updates are achieved in a single request without interactivity.
In fact the only time `@rendermode InteractiveServer` is needed in the default Blazor template is in the
[Counter.razor](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/v8.0.0/src/ProjectTemplates/Web.ProjectTemplates/content/BlazorWeb-CSharp/BlazorWeb-CSharp/Components/Pages/Counter.razor#L3)
page whose C# Event Handling require it.

Ultimately some form of Interactivity will be required when adding behavior or client-side functionality that
runs after pages have rendered, but you still have some options left before being forced to opt into an Interactive Blazor solution.

### Interactive Feature Options

We can see some of these options utilized in the Blazor Template
[NavMenu.razor](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/v8.0.0/src/ProjectTemplates/Web.ProjectTemplates/content/BlazorWeb-CSharp/BlazorWeb-CSharp/Components/Layout/NavMenu.razor)
component which uses Blazor's `@onclick` directive to add client-side behavior to simulate mouse clicks to toggle UI elements:

```html
<div class="nav-scrollable" onclick="document.querySelector('.navbar-toggler').click()">
```

and submitting forms to Logout users:

```html
<LogoutForm id="logout-form" />
<NavLink class="nav-link" onclick="document.getElementById('logout-form').submit(); return false;">
    <span class="bi bi-arrow-bar-left" aria-hidden="true"></span> Logout
</NavLink>
```

Effectively using JavaScript to add interactivity to static rendered pages to avoid paying Blazor's Interactivity tax.

#### Avoid using Interactivity in Layouts

This is especially important for any features you want to add to the Websites Layout or Chrome UI which you'll always want to be
statically rendered so landing pages can load fast and render SEO-friendly server rendered content.

This meant we couldn't use ServiceStack.Blazor's existing [DarkModeToggle.razor](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/main/ServiceStack.Blazor/src/ServiceStack.Blazor/Components/Tailwind/DarkModeToggle.razor)
component for toggling on/off DarkMode since its statically rendered inside the Websites Layout and requires Interactivity to work.

### Vanilla JS Blazor Components

Fortunately utilizing simple element JavaScript callbacks was enough to be able to re-implement its functionality with Vanilla JS
in the new [DarkModeToggleLite.razor](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/main/ServiceStack.Blazor/src/ServiceStack.Blazor/Components/Tailwind/DarkModeToggleLite.razor)
component which works in all Blazor rendering modes, in both full-page or enhanced navigation loads:

```html
<button type="button" onclick="toggleDarkMode()" class=@ClassNames(DarkModeToggle.ButtonClasses, Class) role="switch" aria-checked="false" @attributes="AdditionalAttributes">
    <span class="@DarkModeToggle.InnerClasses" data-class-light="translate-x-5" data-class-dark="translate-x-0">

        html.classList.toggle('dark', isDark)

                    : el.dataset.classDark
            const addClasses = isDark
                    ? el.dataset.classDark
                    : el.dataset.classLight

            removeClasses.split(' ').forEach(c => el.classList.remove(c))
            addClasses.split(' ').forEach(c => el.classList.add(c))
        })
    }
    renderDarkMode()

    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () =>
            Blazor.addEventListener('enhancedload', () => {
                isDark = localStorage.getItem('color-scheme') === 'dark'
                html.classList.toggle('dark', isDark)
                renderDarkMode()
            }))

    return function() {
        isDark = !isDark
        localStorage.setItem('color-scheme', isDark ? 'dark' : 'light')
        renderDarkMode()
    }
})()
</script>
```

### Scripts not re-executed in Enhanced Navigation

To support enhanced navigation you'll need to be aware that `<script>` tags are **only executed once** on initial page load.
You'll instead need to register a callback with Blazor's `enhancedload` event for any startup logic that needs re-executing,
which is fired after Blazor merges the new page's DOM with the existing DOM, and is where the `<DarkModeToggleLite>`
component re-renders itself with the correct state.

### Try it out!

With that it's ready for action, try it out in a new [blazor](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/blazor) Project
or from its Live Demo by toggling on/off Dark Mode Component in the top right corner:

<div class="not-prose mt-8 grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
    <a class="block group border dark:border-gray-800 hover:border-indigo-700 dark:hover:border-indigo-700 flex flex-col justify-between" href="https://blazor-vue.web-templates.io/?light">
        <img class="p-2" src="/img/pages/release-notes/v8/blazor-light.webp">
        <div class="bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 font-semibold group-hover:bg-indigo-700 group-hover:text-white text-center py-2">blazor-vue.web-templates.io?light</div>
    </a>
    <a class="block group border dark:border-gray-800 hover:border-indigo-700 dark:hover:border-indigo-700 flex flex-col justify-between" href="https://blazor-vue.web-templates.io/?dark">
        <img class="p-2" src="/img/pages/release-notes/v8/blazor-dark.webp">
        <div class="bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 font-semibold group-hover:bg-indigo-700 group-hover:text-white text-center py-2">blazor-vue.web-templates.io?dark</div>
    </a>
</div>

### Declarative JavaScript Modules

Unfortunately many other approaches won't work with Blazor's Enhanced Navigation, for example whilst the built-in
ASP.NET Identity Pages all work without Blazor's Interactivity, the [EnableAuthenticator.razor](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/blazor/blob/main/MyApp/Components/Pages/Account/Manage/EnableAuthenticator.razor)
page doesn't actually include a solution for providing a visual QR Code barcode which mobile phones can easily scan to
setup 2FA Authentication.

Whilst the placeholders are there, that implementation detail is left to us to workout, perhaps because they don't want 
to force an Interactivity rendering mode in the default template.

The natural way to implement it is to use the popular [qrcodejs](https://davidshimjs.github.io/qrcodejs/) library
by following its instructions and adding a simple inline script to the page:

#### Don't use in-line scripts for logic that needs to be re-executed

```html
<div data-permanent id="qrCode"></div>
<div id="qrCodeData" data-url="@_authenticatorUri"></div>

<script src="lib/js/qrcode.min.js"></script>
<script>
new QRCode(document.getElementById('qrCode'), 
    document.getElementById('qrCodeData').dataset.url)
</script>
```

Whilst this works as expected in full page reloads, it doesn't work in Blazor's Enhanced Navigation as the `<script>` tag
is only executed once on initial page load and not re-executed when the page is loaded with enhanced navigation.

Your options are to change all links to that page with `data-enhance-nav="false"` to turn off enhanced navigation
to that page, or the solution that worked best for us is to use **declarative instructions** to specify which JavaScript 
modules should be loaded for any page, which we can do by adding a `data-module` attribute to any element, e.g:

```html
<div data-module="pages/Account/Manage/EnableAuthenticator.mjs">
```

These instructions are handled by [app.mjs](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/blazor/blob/main/MyApp/wwwroot/mjs/app.mjs)
on each navigation which loads the JS module and `load()` function if it exists.

Which for `EnableAuthenticator.razor` page loads the
[EnableAuthenticator.mjs](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/blazor/blob/main/MyApp/wwwroot/pages/Account/Manage/EnableAuthenticator.mjs)
JavaScript Module which dynamically loads the `qrcode.min.js` library and initializes the QR Code on its exported `load()` function:

```js
import { addScript, $1 } from "@servicestack/client"
const loadJs = addScript('lib/js/qrcode.min.js')

export default {
    async load() {
        await loadJs
        new QRCode($1("#qrCode"), $1('#qrCodeData').dataset.url)
    }
}
```

Which now works as expected in both full page reloads and Blazor's Enhanced Navigation:

[![](/img/pages/release-notes/v8/blazor-identityauth-qrcode.png)](https://blazor.web-templates.io/Account/Manage/EnableAuthenticator)

### Blazor without Blazor Interactivity

So right now we have a Blazor App that's predominantly statically rendered, with fast and SEO-friendly without any downsides
of the Blazor's Interactivity options, but how much of our App can we implement without Blazor Interactivity?

## Declarative Vue Components

Thankfully we can use the same approach we used for loading JavaScript modules to load Vue.js components, by using the
`data-component` attribute to specify which **global** Vue component to mount with any properties optionally
specified in the`data-props` attribute, e.g:

```html
<div data-component="GettingStarted" data-props="{template:'blazor'}"></div> 
```

This does require ensuring all components loaded this way are registered as a global component, as done in:

```js
import GettingStarted from "./components/GettingStarted.mjs"

/** Shared Global Components */
const Components = {
    GettingStarted,
}

export function mount(sel, component, props) {
    const app = createApp(component, props)
    Object.keys(Components).forEach(name => {
        app.component(name, Components[name])
    })
    app.mount(document.querySelector(sel))
}
```

However this does mean that all global components would need to be downloaded before any Vue Components can be rendered the 
first time a website is accessed. 

### Lazy Loading Vue Components

To avoid this we can instead use the `data-component` attribute to specify the path to the Vue component to load,
ensuring that only the Vue components required for the current page is loaded, e.g:

```html
<div data-component="pages/Counter.mjs"></div> 
```

Which is how we can implement Vue Components that work in statically rendered or enhanced navigation pages:

```js
import { ref } from 'vue'

export default {
    template: `
        <p class="my-4">Current count: {{currentCount}}</p>

        <PrimaryButton @click="incrementCount">Click me</PrimaryButton>
    `,
    setup() {
        const currentCount = ref(0)
        const incrementCount = () => currentCount.value++

        return { currentCount, incrementCount }
    }
}
```

## New .NET 8 Blazor Vue Template!

This ends up being how the Interactive features in the new [blazor-vue](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/blazor-vue) template
are implemented - ideal for building fast, SEO-friendly statically rendered Blazor Web Apps where all its dynamic functionally
uses Vue.js to progressively enhance its static rendered content - eliminating Blazor's limitations of using static
rendering to implement an entire App:

[![](/img/pages/release-notes/v8/blazor-ssr-advantages.webp)](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/blazor-vue)

### Blazor Vue Tailwind Template

The new [blazor-vue](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/blazor-vue) template implements all the features of the
[blazor](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/blazor) template but reimplements all its interactive features with
Vue.js to and the [Vue Components](/vue/) library.

### Faster iterative development

Other benefits of using Vue for Interactivity is the fast iterative feedback loop during development that even applies
to its [Markdown-powered Blog](https://blazor-vue.web-templates.io/blog) which itself can embed rich interactive Vue Components and rich JavaScript UIs
like Chart.js in its [Markdown Blog Posts](https://blazor-vue.web-templates.io/posts/razor-ssg-new-blog-features) thanks to its unapologetic, complexity-free
[#NoBuild](https://world.hey.com/dhh/you-can-t-get-faster-than-no-build-7a44131c) solution.

### Statically Rendered Blazor Apps

Whilst Blazor Interactivity may remain the predominant solution amongst .NET developers we believe .NET 8 Blazor opens the doors
for progressively enhanced statically-rendered Blazor Apps which has now become our preferred solution for developing
most .NET Web Apps.

It overcomes our biggest gripe with Blazor Web Assembly, that we were unsuccessful in
[prerendering away](https://github.com/LegacyTemplates/blazor-tailwind/blob/main/MyApp.Client/wwwroot/content/prerender.md) its poor startup performance and UI jank
in Internet Apps.

## Blazor Vue Diffusion

So when we learned about .NET 8's static default rendering mode and enhanced navigation we jumped at the opportunity to
create the Blazor Vue template which was used to re-implement Blazor Diffusion with Blazor SSR and Vue.js - a statically
rendered Blazor App that uses Vue.js for all its functionality.

<h3 class="not-prose text-center pb-8">
    <a class="text-4xl text-blue-600 hover:underline" href="https://blazordiffusion.com">https://blazordiffusion.com</a>
</h3>

[Blazor Diffusion](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/BlazorDiffusion) is our Blazor Demo App we used to showcase how you
could use [Universal API Components](https://youtu.be/66DgLHExC9E) to build Blazor Components and entire Blazor Apps
whose source code runs in both Blazor Server and Blazor Web Assembly Interactive modes, which was first
developed with [Blazor Server](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/BlazorDiffusion) then used a
[sync.bat](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/BlazorDiffusionWasm/blob/main/sync.bat) script to export its source code into
a [Blazor Web Assembly](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/BlazorDiffusionWasm) project that was deployed instead.

The Blazor Vue version starts from a clean slate, utilizing statically rendered Blazor for faster page loads and generating
SEO-friendly content:

[![](/img/pages/release-notes/v8/blazordiffusionvue.webp)](https://blazordiffusion.com/)

We're very pleased with the results, much faster loading times, enhanced navigation, no UI jankiness, better SEO - essentially
a better UX overall, despite not needing any prerendering solution - all whilst enjoying a faster iterative development experience
where all Vue component changes were immediately visible after save.

## ASP.NET Core Identity Auth in .NET 8 Templates

A significant change we've added to our new .NET 8 Project Templates is the adoption of the same
ASP.NET Core Identity Authentication that's configured in Microsoft's default Projects templates.

### History of ServiceStack Authentication

Since the dawn of ServiceStack we've always maintained our own [Authentication and Authorization](/auth/authentication-and-authorization)
provider model, primarily as it was the only way to provide an integrated and unified Authentication model
that worked across all our supported hosting platforms, inc. .NET Framework, ASP.NET Core on .NET Framework, HttpListener
and what's now .NET (fka .NET Core).

Whilst the Authentication story in ASP.NET has undergone several cycles of changes over the years, the ServiceStack
Auth Model has  remained relatively consistent and stable, with no schema changes required since release whilst still
providing flexible options for [extending UserAuth tables](https://docs.servicestack.net/auth/auth-repository#extending-userauth-tables) and typed [User Sessions](https://docs.servicestack.net/auth/sessions#using-typed-sessions-in-servicestack).

#### .NET Framework considered legacy

Although the multi-platform support of the unified Authentication model has been vital for Organizations migrating their systems
to .NET (Core) where ServiceStack Customers have been able to enjoy [Exceptional Code reuse](/netcore#exceptional-code-reuse),
it's become clear that the .NET platform (e.g. .NET 8) is the only platform that should be considered for new projects and
that .NET Framework should only be considered a stable legacy platform for running existing systems on.

Given Microsoft has committed to [Authentication Improvements in .NET 8](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/whats-new-with-identity-in-dotnet-8/)
it's become more important to easily integrate ServiceStack with new and existing .NET projects to access these new features
than to continue recommending ServiceStack's unified Auth Providers as the default option for new projects.

### ASP.NET Core Identity Auth now used in new Integrated Auth projects

Going forward all new ServiceStack .NET Project Templates will adopt ASP.NET Identity Auth, which closely follows the
same approach as the Microsoft Project Template it integrates ServiceStack with, e.g. the new .NET 8
**Blazor** and **Blazor Vue** project templates adopts the exact same
Auth configuration as Microsoft's default Blazor Project Template configured with **Individual** Identity Auth, 
likewise with the **Bootstrap** and **Tailwind** styled **MVC** and **Razor Pages** templates.

Where you can now create new ServiceStack Integrated Identity Auth Templates for each of ASP.NET Core's major Blazor, 
Razor Pages and MVC Templates:

<div class="not-prose mx-auto px-8">
  <h3 id="identityauth-template" class="mb-4 text-4xl tracking-tight font-extrabold text-gray-900">
      Create a Project with ASP.NET Identity Auth
  </h3>
  <identity-auth-templates></identity-auth-templates>
</div>

The configuration and source code for the above projects are a good reference for how to configure ServiceStack with
Identity Auth in your own projects.

The **Bootstrap** versions use same Individual Identity Auth Pages that Microsoft's **Razor Pages** and **MVC** templates use, 
whilst the **Tailwind** versions have been enhanced to use **Tailwind CSS** instead of Bootstrap, 
includes a **visual QR Code** implementation that was missing and includes an
`IEmailSender` SMTP solution that's easily enabled via Configuration to use your preferred **SMTP Server**.

### Migrating to ASP.NET Core Identity Auth

Migrating from ServiceStack Auth to Identity Auth should be relatively straight-forward as ServiceStack uses a compatible
Identity v2 password hashing format, which should let you migrate your users to Identity Auth without them noticing.

To help with any migrations we've published an [Identity Auth Migration Guide](/auth/migrate-to-identity-auth) we've used
to convert existing ServiceStack Auth Apps to use Identity Auth.

## ServiceStack's Identity Auth Integration

ServiceStack's Identity Auth integration is focused on high compatibility so existing ServiceStack Customers
require minimal effort to migrate existing code bases to use the new Identity Auth integration, despite Identity Auth
being an entirely different Auth Provider model and implementation.

It does this by retaining a lot of the existing user-facing Authentication and Session abstractions that ServiceStack APIs
use for Authorization as well as existing endpoints and Request/Response DTOs that ServiceStack Clients use to Authenticate,
but replace their internal implementation to use ASP.NET Identity Auth instead.

The new Identity Auth integration is contained in the .NET 6+ **ServiceStack.Extensions** NuGet package:

```xml
<PackageReference Include="ServiceStack.Extensions" Version="8.*" />
```

Which at a minimum lets you configure ServiceStack to use Identity Auth by simply registering the existing `AuthFeature`
plugin with the Application's custom EF `ApplicationUser` Data Model:

```csharp
Plugins.Add(new AuthFeature(IdentityAuth.For<ApplicationUser>()));
```

It requires minimal configuration as all Authorization is configured using ASP.NET Core's
standard APIs, any configuration in this plugin is then just used to customize Identity Auth's integration with ServiceStack.

There's also no new concepts to learn as all ASP .NET Core endpoints, pages and controllers continue to Authenticate against
the populated `ClaimsPrincipal` whilst all ServiceStack APIs continue to Authenticate against the populated typed
[User Session](/auth/sessions).

The `AuthFeature` works by registering the following Identity Auth Providers:

### Identity Auth Providers

- [IdentityApplicationAuthProvider](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/main/ServiceStack/src/ServiceStack.Extensions/Auth/IdentityApplicationAuthProvider.cs) - Converts an Identity Auth `ClaimsPrincipal` into a ServiceStack Session
- [IdentityCredentialsAuthProvider](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/main/ServiceStack/src/ServiceStack.Extensions/Auth/IdentityCredentialsAuthProvider.cs) - Implements ServiceStack's `Authenticate` API using Identity Auth
- [IdentityJwtAuthProvider](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/main/ServiceStack/src/ServiceStack.Extensions/Auth/IdentityJwtAuthProvider.cs) - Converts an Identity Auth JWT into an Authenticated ServiceStack Session

Only the `IdentityApplicationAuthProvider` is registered by default which is required to convert Identity Auth's `ClaimPrincipal`
into an Authenticated ServiceStack [Session](/auth/sessions). The other Auth Providers are required if you want to enable authentication with
ServiceStack's endpoints. E.g. ServiceStack's [Built-in UIs](https://servicestack.net/auto-ui) would require the Credentials Auth
to be enabled to authenticate via the built-in Sign In dialogs.

### Configuring Auth Providers

Which is what all the Blazor and MVC Identity Auth templates enable by default in
[Configure.Auth.cs](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/blazor/blob/main/MyApp/Configure.Auth.cs):

```csharp
public class ConfigureAuth : IHostingStartup
{
    public void Configure(IWebHostBuilder builder) => builder
        .ConfigureAppHost(appHost => 
        {
            appHost.Plugins.Add(new AuthFeature(IdentityAuth.For<ApplicationUser>(
                // Configure ServiceStack's Integration with Identity Auth
                options => {
                    options.SessionFactory = () => new CustomUserSession();
                    options.CredentialsAuth();
                })
            ));
        });
}
```

If you're using a `CustomUserSession` you'll also need to register it with the `SessionFactory` for it to be used.

Each of the Identity Auth Providers can also be customized individually:

```csharp
Plugins.Add(new AuthFeature(IdentityAuth.For<ApplicationUser>(options => {
        // Configure IdentityApplicationAuthProvider
        options.ApplicationAuth(options => {});

        // Configure IdentityCredentialsAuthProvider
        options.CredentialsAuth(options => {});

        // Configure IdentityJwtAuthProvider
        options.JwtAuth(options => {});
    })
));
```

Typically you'll want to use the included Identity UI Pages and dependencies to register new users and assign roles,
but if you have any existing client integrations that use ServiceStack APIs they can also be enabled with:

```csharp
Plugins.Add(new AuthFeature(IdentityAuth.For<ApplicationUser>(options => {
    // Include ServiceStack's Register API
    options.IncludeRegisterService = true;
    
    // Include ServiceStack's AssignRoles and UnAssignRoles APIs
    options.IncludeAssignRoleServices = true;
));
```

### Extending Identity Auth Cookies and User Sessions

By default all [well known Claim Names](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/3ab3d23c85cf48435b8cd9386f25afab79fcb542/ServiceStack/src/ServiceStack.Extensions/Auth/IdentityApplicationAuthProvider.cs#L49)
are used to populate the User Session, but you can also include additional claims in the Identity Auth Cookie
and use them to populate the User Session by overriding `PopulateFromClaims()` in your
[CustomUserSession.cs](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/blazor/blob/main/MyApp.ServiceInterface/Data/CustomUserSession.cs), e.g:

```csharp
public class CustomUserSession : AuthUserSession
{
    public override void PopulateFromClaims(IRequest httpReq, ClaimsPrincipal principal)
    {
        // Populate Session with data from Identity Auth Claims
        ProfileUrl = principal.FindFirstValue(JwtClaimTypes.Picture);
    }
}

// Add additional claims to the Identity Auth Cookie
public class AdditionalUserClaimsPrincipalFactory(UserManager<ApplicationUser> userManager, RoleManager<IdentityRole> roleManager, IOptions<IdentityOptions> optionsAccessor)
    : UserClaimsPrincipalFactory<ApplicationUser,IdentityRole>(userManager, roleManager, optionsAccessor)
{
    public override async Task<ClaimsPrincipal> CreateAsync(ApplicationUser user)
    {
        var principal = await base.CreateAsync(user);
        var identity = (ClaimsIdentity)principal.Identity!;

        var claims = new List<Claim>();
        // Add additional claims here
        if (user.ProfileUrl != null)
        {
            claims.Add(new Claim(JwtClaimTypes.Picture, user.ProfileUrl));
        }

        identity.AddClaims(claims);
        return principal;
    }
}
```

### Custom Application User Primary Key

The default `IdentityUser` uses a `string` as the primary key populated with a `Guid`, but you could also change it to use an
`int` by having your EF IdentityUser Data Model inherit from `IdentityUser<int>` instead:

```csharp
public class AppUser : IdentityUser<int>
{
    //...
}
```

You'll also need to specify the Key Type when registering the `AuthFeature` plugin:

```csharp
public class ConfigureAuth : IHostingStartup
{
    public void Configure(IWebHostBuilder builder) => builder
        .ConfigureAppHost(appHost => {
            appHost.Plugins.Add(new AuthFeature(IdentityAuth.For<AppUser,int>(
                options => {
                    options.SessionFactory = () => new CustomUserSession();
                    options.CredentialsAuth();
                })
            ));
        });
}
```

Which the new .NET 8 BlazorDiffusion App does in [Configure.Auth.cs](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/BlazorDiffusionVue/blob/main/BlazorDiffusion/Configure.Auth.cs)
to be compatible with its existing ServiceStack `UserAuth` tables which used an `int` primary key.

## Using Identity Auth in ServiceStack Apps

One of the primary benefits of adopting Identity Auth is the wealth of documentation and resources available for it,
which also applies to how you would use Identity Auth to secure your own Apps.

If you're new to Identity Auth we recommend starting with the official introduction from Microsoft:

- [Introduction to Identity on ASP.NET Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/identity)

To learn about securing Blazor Apps, go to:

- [ASP.NET Core Blazor authentication and authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/security/)

### Declarative Validation Attributes

The recommended way to protect your ServiceStack APIs is to continue to use the [Declarative Validation](/declarative-validation)
attributes which are decoupled from any implementation so be safely annotated on Request DTOs without adding
any implementation dependencies, where they're also accessible to Clients and UIs using the Request DTOs to invoke your APIs.

The available Typed Authorization Attributes include:

| Attribute                   | Description                                            |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `[ValidateIsAuthenticated]` | Restrict access toAuthenticated Users only             |
| `[ValidateIsAdmin]`         | Restrict access to Admin Users only                    |
| `[ValidateHasRole]`         | Restrict access to only Users assigned with this Role  |
| `[ValidateHasClaim]`        | Restrict access to only Users assigned with this Claim |
| `[ValidateHasScope]`        | Restrict access to only Users assigned with this Scope |

That can be annotated on **Request DTOs** to protect APIs:

```csharp
[ValidateIsAuthenticated]
[ValidateIsAdmin]
[ValidateHasRole(role)]
[ValidateHasClaim(type,value)]
[ValidateHasScope(scope)]
public class Secured {}
```

### Using Identity Auth in ServiceStack Clients

As ServiceStack Identity Auth integration registers replacements Auth Providers for ServiceStack's built-in Auth Providers,
existing ServiceStack Client integrations will continue to work without any changes, e.g:

```csharp
const client = new JsonApiClient(baseUrl);

var response = await client.ApiAsync(new Authenticate {
    provider = "credentials",
    UserName = userName,
    Password = password,
});
```

The difference being that instead of returning an Authenticated ServiceStack Session Cookie, it instead returns an 
ASP.NET's Identity `.AspNetCore.Identity.Application` Cookie which it will be used to perform Authenticated API requests.

This transparent re-implementation of ServiceStack Auth Providers and endpoints is also how ServiceStack's 
[Built-in UIs](https://servicestack.net/auto-ui) was able to continue to work without any code changes.

### SMTP IEmailSender

The .NET 8 Templates also include a nice solution for sending Identity Auth emails through the `IEmailSender` interface
which drops the Email Request in the registered Background MQ in
[Configure.Mq.cs](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/blazor/blob/main/MyApp/Configure.Mq.cs)
which uses it to invoke the `SendEmail` API in
[EmailServices](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/blazor/blob/main/MyApp.ServiceInterface/EmailServices.cs) in a
managed background worker:

```csharp
public class EmailSender(IMessageService messageService) : IEmailSender
{
    public Task SendEmailAsync(string email, string subject, string htmlMessage)
    {
        using var mqClient = messageService.CreateMessageProducer();
        mqClient.Publish(new SendEmail
        {
            To = email,
            Subject = subject,
            BodyHtml = htmlMessage,
        });

        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
```

To enable it you'll need to register your preferred SMTP Server in your App's `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "SmtpConfig": {
    "Username": "username",
    "Password": "password",
    "Host": "smtp.mailtrap.io",
    "Port": 587,
    "FromEmail": "mail@example.org"
  }
}
```

Then uncomment the `EmailSender` registration in your `Program.cs`

```csharp
services.AddSingleton<IEmailSender, EmailSender>();
```

### Send any App Email

The nice part about this solution is that it's not limited to just sending Identity Auth emails, you can also use it to send
any App Email, either by publishing a message to the registered MQ with `PublishMessage` or by using the
[Service Gateway](/service-gateway) to invoke the API directly, e.g:

```csharp
public class MyServices : Service
{
    public object Any(MyRequest request)
    {
        // Send Email in managed Background MQ Worker
        PublishMessage(new SendEmail {
            To = email,
            Subject = subject,
            BodyHtml = body,
        });

        // Block until Email is sent to SMTP Serve
        Gateway.Send(new SendEmail {
            To = email,
            Subject = subject,
            BodyHtml = body,
        });
    }
}
```

ServiceStack's **Add ServiceStack Reference** feature allows clients to generate Native Types from directly within 
PhpStorm using [ServiceStack IntelliJ Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7749-servicestack/) - providing a simple way to give clients typed access to your 
ServiceStack Services.

### First class development experience

[PHP](https://www.php.net) is one of the worlds most popular programming languages thanks to its ease of use,
platform independence, large standard library, flexibility and fast development experience which sees it excels as
a popular language for web development and for development of popular CMS products like WordPress, Drupal and Joomla
thanks to its flexibility, embeddability and ease of customization.

To maximize the experience for calling ServiceStack APIs within these environments ServiceStack now supports PHP as a
1st class Add ServiceStack Reference supported language which gives PHP developers an end-to-end typed API for consuming
ServiceStack APIs, complete with IDE integration in [PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) as well as
[built-in support in x dotnet tool](/dotnet-tool#addupdate-servicestack-references)
to generate Typed and annotated PHP DTOs for a remote ServiceStack instance from a single command-line.

### Ideal idiomatic Typed Message-based API

To maximize the utility of PHP DTOs and enable richer tooling support and greater development experience, PHP DTOs are generated as
Typed [JsonSerializable](https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.jsonserializable.php) classes with
[promoted constructors](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.decon.php#language.oop5.decon.constructor.promotion)
and annotated with [PHPDoc Types](https://phpstan.org/writing-php-code/phpdoc-types) - that's invaluable when scaling
large PHP code-bases and greatly improves discoverability of a remote API. DTOs are also enriched with interface markers
and Annotations which enables its optimal end-to-end typed API:

The PHP DTOs and `JsonServiceClient` library follow
[PHP naming conventions](https://infinum.com/handbook/wordpress/coding-standards/php-coding-standards/naming)
so they'll naturally fit into existing PHP code bases. Here's a sample of [techstacks.io](https://techstacks.io)
generated PHP DTOs containing string and int Enums, an example AutoQuery and a standard Request & Response DTO showcasing
the rich typing annotations and naming conventions used:

```php
enum TechnologyTier : string
{
    case ProgrammingLanguage = 'ProgrammingLanguage';
    case Client = 'Client';
    case Http = 'Http';
    case Server = 'Server';
    case Data = 'Data';
    case SoftwareInfrastructure = 'SoftwareInfrastructure';
    case OperatingSystem = 'OperatingSystem';
    case HardwareInfrastructure = 'HardwareInfrastructure';
    case ThirdPartyServices = 'ThirdPartyServices';
}

enum Frequency : int
{
    case Daily = 1;
    case Weekly = 7;
    case Monthly = 30;
    case Quarterly = 90;
}

// @Route("/technology/search")
#[Returns('QueryResponse')]
/**
 * @template QueryDb of Technology
 * @template QueryDb1 of TechnologyView
 */
class FindTechnologies extends QueryDb implements IReturn, IGet, JsonSerializable
{
    public function __construct(
        /** @var array<int>|null */
        public ?array $ids=null,
        /** @var string|null */
        public ?string $name=null,
        /** @var string|null */
        public ?string $vendorName=null,
        /** @var string|null */
        public ?string $nameContains=null,
        /** @var string|null */
        public ?string $vendorNameContains=null,
        /** @var string|null */
        public ?string $descriptionContains=null
    ) {
    }

    /** @throws Exception */
    public function fromMap($o): void {
        parent::fromMap($o);
        if (isset($o['ids'])) $this->ids = JsonConverters::fromArray('int', $o['ids']);
        if (isset($o['name'])) $this->name = $o['name'];
        if (isset($o['vendorName'])) $this->vendorName = $o['vendorName'];
        if (isset($o['nameContains'])) $this->nameContains = $o['nameContains'];
        if (isset($o['vendorNameContains'])) $this->vendorNameContains = $o['vendorNameContains'];
        if (isset($o['descriptionContains'])) $this->descriptionContains = $o['descriptionContains'];
    }
    
    /** @throws Exception */
    public function jsonSerialize(): mixed
    {
        $o = parent::jsonSerialize();
        if (isset($this->ids)) $o['ids'] = JsonConverters::toArray('int', $this->ids);
        if (isset($this->name)) $o['name'] = $this->name;
        if (isset($this->vendorName)) $o['vendorName'] = $this->vendorName;
        if (isset($this->nameContains)) $o['nameContains'] = $this->nameContains;
        if (isset($this->vendorNameContains)) $o['vendorNameContains'] = $this->vendorNameContains;
        if (isset($this->descriptionContains)) $o['descriptionContains'] = $this->descriptionContains;
        return empty($o) ? new class(){} : $o;
    }
    public function getTypeName(): string { return 'FindTechnologies'; }
    public function getMethod(): string { return 'GET'; }
    public function createResponse(): mixed { return QueryResponse::create(genericArgs:['TechnologyView']); }
}

// @Route("/orgs/{Id}", "DELETE")
class DeleteOrganization implements IReturnVoid, IDelete, JsonSerializable
{
    public function __construct(
        /** @var int */
        public int $id=0
    ) {
    }

    /** @throws Exception */
    public function fromMap($o): void {
        if (isset($o['id'])) $this->id = $o['id'];
    }
    
    /** @throws Exception */
    public function jsonSerialize(): mixed
    {
        $o = [];
        if (isset($this->id)) $o['id'] = $this->id;
        return empty($o) ? new class(){} : $o;
    }
    public function getTypeName(): string { return 'DeleteOrganization'; }
    public function getMethod(): string { return 'DELETE'; }
    public function createResponse(): void {}
}
```

The smart PHP `JsonServiceClient` available in the [servicestack/client](https://packagist.org/packages/servicestack/client)
packagist package enables the same productive, typed API development experience available in our other 1st-class supported
client platforms.

Using promoted constructors enables DTOs to be populated using a single constructor expression utilizing named parameters
which together with the generic `JsonServiceClient` enables end-to-end typed API Requests in a single LOC:

```php
use Servicestack\JsonServiceClient;
use dtos\Hello;

$client = new JsonServiceClient("https://test.servicestack.net");

/** @var HelloResponse $response */
$response = client->get(new Hello(name:"World"));
```

> The `HelloResponse` optional type hint doesn't change runtime behavior but enables static analysis tools and IDEs like PyCharm to provide rich intelli-sense and development time feedback.

## Installation

Ensure you have [PHP](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php) and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md) installed.

The only requirements for PHP apps to perform typed API Requests are the generated PHP DTOs and the generic `JsonServiceClient`
which can be installed in Composer projects with:

```bash
$ composer require servicestack/client
```

Or by adding the package to your `composer.json` then installing the dependencies:

```json
{
  "require": {
    "servicestack/client": "^1.0"
  }
}
```

### PhpStorm ServiceStack Plugin

PHP developers of [PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) can get a simplified development experience for consuming
ServiceStack Services by installing the [ServiceStack Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7749-servicestack) from the JetBrains Marketplace:

[![](/img/pages/servicestack-reference/phpstorm-servicestack-plugin.webp)](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7749-servicestack)

Where you'll be able to right-click on a directory and click on **ServiceStack Reference** on the context menu:

![](/img/pages/servicestack-reference/phpstorm-add-servicestack-reference.webp)

To launch the **Add PHP ServiceStack Reference** dialog where you can enter the remote URL of the ServiceStack endpoint you wish to call to generate the Typed PHP DTOs for all APIs which by default will saved to `dtos.php`:

![](/img/pages/servicestack-reference/phpstorm-add-servicestack-reference-dialog.webp)

Then just import the DTOs and `JsonServiceClient` to be able to consume any of the remote ServiceStack APIs:

```php
<?php

require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php'; // Autoload files using Composer autoload
require_once 'dtos.php';

use dtos\FindTechnologies;
use Servicestack\JsonServiceClient;

$client = JsonServiceClient::create("https://techstacks.io");

$response = $client->send(new FindTechnologies(
    ids: [1,2,4,6],
    vendorName: "Google"));

print_r($response);
```

If any of the the remote APIs change their DTOs can be updated by right-clicking on `dtos.php` and clicking **Update ServiceStack Reference**:

![](/img/pages/servicestack-reference/phpstorm-update-servicestack-reference.webp)

For more usage examples and information about ServiceStack's PHP support checkout the 
[PHP Add ServiceStack Reference](/php-add-servicestack-reference) docs.
