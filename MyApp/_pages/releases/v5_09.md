title: ServiceStack v5.9
released: 2020-06-10
---

We're excited to announce the culmination of many high-level productivity features ServiceStack gained in this release that makes it vastly 
more productive to rapidly develop data-driven APIs which has seen AutoQuery gain full CRUD support where it's now able to 
declaratively implement Create, Updates, Partial Updates and Deletes APIs.

To maximize their utility AutoQuery/CRUD Services gain additional declarative powers whereby most common operations can continue to 
be implemented entirely from just their declarative Request DTO definition which is able to apply mandatory filters to limit 
Multitenant & Soft Deleted records, populate internal data models with Audit info & Complex Expressions, Auto Mapping between 
different DTO & Data Model properties, support for Optimistic concurrency & the ability to easily enable high-end App-level features 
like full Executable Audit History for all CRUD operations enabling EventSourcing-like capabilities in being able to re-create 
entity state by re-running their Audit History.

Whilst all Services benefit from the new enhanced Fluent Validation capabilities where all built-in validators can now be applied declaratively, 
including new support for top-level "Type Validators" which can be used to enforce Type Authorization rules directly on DTOs without 
implementation dependencies. Declarative validation rules can also sourced from dynamic sources like an RDBMS where they're both instantly applied 
at runtime & cached locally for max performance.

### v5.9.2 Patch Release Notes

If you're [using JWT Auth please upgrade to v5.9.2](/auth/jwt-authprovider#upgrade-to-v592) when possible to resolve a JWT signature verification issue.

## Introducing ServiceStack Studio!

Another exciting development in this release is the successor to [Admin UI](https://github.com/ServiceStack/Admin): 
**ServiceStack Studio!** - a capability-based UI to manage multiple remote ServiceStack instances from either a Chromium Desktop App 
or cross-platform .NET Core Web App. 

The richer metadata in ServiceStack Services allows Studio to logically group Services around Data Models, enabling its high-level
semantic features like its native data-grid like UX over all AutoQuery Services to quickly discover, search, create, update and 
delete entities based on the available AutoQuery APIs and whether Authenticated Users have access to them.

[![](/img/pages/release-notes/v5.9/studio-home.png)](https://youtu.be/2FFRLxs7orU)

## Instantly Servicify existing Systems!

ServiceStack also reached maximum autonomy for a Services framework where in addition to **AutoQuery** automatically providing your Services implementations, 
**Studio** providing its instant UI, ServiceStack also gained the capability to **generate your entire API!** Including Typed API contracts,
data models, implementations & human-friendly pluralized HTTP API routes over an existing System RDBMS's tables!

ServiceStack's **AutoGen** enables a number of exciting possibilities, predominantly it's the fastest way to ServiceStack-ify an
existing systems RDBMS where it will serve as an invaluable tool for anyone wanting to quickly migrate to ServiceStack and access its 
functionality ecosystem around ServiceStack Services:

<img src="/img/pages/svg/servicify.svg" width="100%">

**AutoGen's** code generation is programmatically customizable where the generated types can be easily augmented with additional declarative attributes 
to inject your App's conventions into the auto generated Services & Types to apply custom behavior like Authorization & additional validation rules. 
After codifying your system conventions the generated classes can optionally be "ejected" where code-first development can continue as normal.

This feature enables rewriting parts or modernizing legacy systems with the least amount of time & effort, once Servicified you can take advantage 
of declarative features like Multitenancy, Optimistic Concurrency & Validation, enable automatic features like Executable Audit History,
allow business users to maintain validation rules in its RDBMS, manage them through **Studio** & have them applied instantly at runtime 
and visibly surfaced through ServiceStack's myriad of [client UI auto-binding options](/world-validation). **Studio** can then enable stakeholders 
with an instant UI to quickly access and search through their data, import custom queries directly into Excel or access them in other registered 
Content Types through a custom UI where fine-grained app-level access can be applied to customize which tables & operations different users have.

### gRPC's Typed protoc Universe

<img src="/img/pages/svg/grpc-icon-color.svg" height="100" align="right">

**AutoGen** also enables access to ServiceStack's ecosystem of metadata services & connectivity options where it's now become the 
**fastest way to generate gRPC endpoints** over an existing system. This is especially exciting as in addition to enabling high-performance 
connectivity to your Systems data, it opens it up to [all languages in gRPC's protoc universe](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/).

Whilst the Smart, Generic [C# / F# / VB.NET Service Clients](/grpc/generic) continue to provide the best UX for consuming gRPC Services, one of 
the nicest **protoc generated** clients languages is [Dart](http://dart.dev) - a modern high-level language with native class performance & 
script-like productivity where individual source files can be run immediately without compilation, it's quality tooling, static analysis &
high-level features like async/await make it an ideal exploratory language for consuming gRPC endpoints.

### Dart gRPC Script Playground

<img src="/img/pages/svg/dart-logo.svg" height="75" align="right">

This quick demo shows an example of instantly Servicifying a database & accesses it via gRPC in minutes, starting with a new 
[grpc](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/grpc) project from scratch, it [mixes](/mix-tool) in 
[autocrudgen](https://gist.github.com/gistlyn/464a80c15cb3af4f41db7810082dc00c) to configure **AutoGen** to generate 
AutoQuery services for the registered [sqlite](https://gist.github.com/gistlyn/768d7b330b8c977f43310b954ceea668) RDBMS
that's copied into the project from the [northwind.sqlite](https://gist.github.com/gistlyn/97d0bcd3ebd582e06c85f8400683e037) gist.

Once the servicified App is running it accesses the gRPC Services in a new Dart Console App using the UX-friendly
[Dart gRPC support in the x dotnet tool](/grpc/dart) to call the protoc generated Services:

### Flutter gRPC Android App

<img src="/img/pages/svg/flutter-logo.svg" height="75" align="right">

And if you can access it from Dart, you can access it from all platforms Dart runs on - the most exciting is Google's [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) 
UI Kit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for Mobile, Web, and Desktop from a single codebase:

[![](/img/pages/release-notes/v5.9/autogen-grpc-flutter.jpg)](https://youtu.be/3iz9aM1AlGA)

### React Native Typed Client

<img src="/img/pages/svg/react-native-logo.svg" width="300" align="right">

gRPC is just [one of the endpoints ServiceStack Services](/why-servicestack#multiple-clients) can be accessed from, for an even richer & 
more integrated development UX they're also available in all popular Mobile, Web & Desktop languages 
[Add ServiceStack Reference](/add-servicestack-reference) supports.

Like [TypeScript](/typescript-add-servicestack-reference) which can be used in Browser & Node TypeScript code-bases as well as JavaScript-only
code-bases like [React Native](https://reactnative.dev) - a highly productive Reactive UI for developing iOS and Android Apps:

[![](/img/pages/release-notes/v5.9/autogen-react-native.png)](https://youtu.be/6-SiLAbY63w)

### autodto - Generate Types for RDBMS Tables

An unintended consequence of **AutoGen** that's potentially universally appealing to even non .NET developers is that it's also a way to instantly
generate Types for all RDBMS tables in all of ServiceStack [supported client languages](/add-servicestack-reference), 
which thanks to being configurable in a [Sharp App](https://sharpscript.net/docs/sharp-apps) can be executed from the command-line using
the [dotnet tools](/dotnet-tool):
```
$ dotnet tool install --global x
```
We can then use the [mix feature](/mix-tool) to download the [autodto](https://gist.github.com/gistlyn/c6567f32ba7de2eb760dc776f3067e78) gist
containing a pre-configured `app.settings`, with the only configuration required is the RDBMS it should connect to, which you can
specify in a single-command when writing the gist, e.g:
```
$ x mix autodto -replace DIALECT=<dialect> -replace CONNECTION_STRING="<connection-string>"
```
> Dialect: sqlite, sqlserver, postgres, mysql

Or if preferred the connection string can be referenced from an Environment variable with the `$` prefix, e.g:
```
$ x mix autodto -replace DIALECT=postgres -replace CONNECTION_STRING=$TECHSTACKS_DB
```
<table class="table table-bordered" style="text-align:center">
<tr>
    <td><a href="/csharp-add-servicestack-reference">C#</a></td>
    <td><a href="/typescript-add-servicestack-reference">TypeScript</a></td>
    <td><a href="/swift-add-servicestack-reference">Swift</a></td>
    <td><a href="/java-add-servicestack-reference">Java</a></td>
    <td><a href="/kotlin-add-servicestack-reference">Kotlin</a></td>
    <td><a href="/dart-add-servicestack-reference">Dart</a></td>
    <td><a href="/fsharp-add-servicestack-reference">F#</a></td>
    <td><a href="/vbnet-add-servicestack-reference">VB.NET</a></td>
</tr>
</table>

[![](/img/pages/release-notes/v5.9/autodto-youtube.png)](https://youtu.be/1dFqzrF1mV8)

If you don't have an RDBMS readily available to test this on, you can also mix in a copy of the **northwind.sqlite** database & configure it with the same command:
```
$ x mix autodto northwind.sqlite -replace DIALECT=sqlite -replace CONNECTION_STRING=northwind.sqlite
```
Alternatively you can download and update separately with: 
```
$ x mix autodto
```
Then use a text editor to update `app.settings` with your RDBMS configuration:
```
debug true
name Auto DTO
defaultRedirect /metadata
features AutoQueryFeature
AutoQueryFeature { MaxLimit: 100 }
AutoQueryFeature.GenerateCrudServices { }

# Configure below. Supported dialects: sqlite, sqlserver, postgres, mysql
db sqlite
db.connection northwind.sqlite
```
Once configured, start this ServiceStack App with:
```
$ x
```
Then in another terminal you can download just the generated **Types** in each language you want, by excluding their **Services**:
```
$ x csharp https://localhost:5001 -path /crud/all/csharp?ExcludeTypes=services
$ x typescript https://localhost:5001 -path /crud/all/typescript?ExcludeTypes=services
$ x dart https://localhost:5001 -path /crud/all/dart?ExcludeTypes=services
$ x java https://localhost:5001 -path /crud/all/java?ExcludeTypes=services
$ x kotlin https://localhost:5001 -path /crud/all/kotlin?ExcludeTypes=services
$ x swift https://localhost:5001 -path /crud/all/swift?ExcludeTypes=services
$ x vbnet https://localhost:5001 -path /crud/all/vbnet?ExcludeTypes=services
$ x fsharp https://localhost:5001 -path /crud/all/fsharp?ExcludeTypes=services
```
Every language is customizable using their [DTO Customization Options](/csharp-add-servicestack-reference#dto-customization-options) so you 
could uncomment the `GlobalNamespace` option to generate types in your preferred namespace instead:
```
GlobalNamespace: TechStacks
```
Then regenerate it using the full language name above or their wrist-friendly 2-letter abbreviation:
```
x cs
x ts
x da
x ja
x kt
x sw
x vb
x fs
```
> Or put this in a `.bat` or `.sh` script to automate re-generation for all languages in a single command.

## Introducing SharpData!

Before we delve into the typed world of AutoCrud, we'd like to introduce the [SharpData](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/SharpData) .NET Core project -
another generic tool (useful for non .NET devs) for providing an instant UI around multiple RDBMS's:

> YouTube: [youtu.be/GjVipOqwZMA](https://youtu.be/GjVipOqwZMA)

[![](/img/pages/release-notes/v5.9/sharpdata-custom-appsettings.png)](https://youtu.be/GjVipOqwZMA)

It makes use of the [app](/netcore-windows-desktop) dotnet tool for running Chromium
[Gist Desktop Apps](https://sharpscript.net/sharp-apps/gist-desktop-apps) on-the-fly without installation, from a single URL that can also
[mix in additional gists](/mix-tool) which can be used in SharpData to configure RDBMS's, copy SQLite databases and
apply per-database customizations to add navigable deep links and customized UI Views to each table resultset.

Whilst SharpData supports [connecting to most popular RDBMS's](/ormlite/#ormlite-rdbms-providers), it's 
especially useful for being able to deploy an instant stand-alone UI with an embedded SQLite databases which can be published independently in a gist and
launched from a single URL.

For an example of this in action we've published customized gists for the 
[Northwind](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/downloading-sample-databases) and 
[Chinook](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-sample-database/) SQLite databases which after installing the latest 
[app](/netcore-windows-desktop) dotnet tool:

```
$ dotnet tool install -g app    
```

Can be run from the link below in a Windows x64 Desktop App:

<ul>
    <li><strong><a name="app://sharpdata?mix=northwind.sharpdata">app://sharpdata?mix=northwind.sharpdata</a></strong></li>
    <li><strong><a name="app://sharpdata?mix=chinook.sharpdata">app://sharpdata?mix=chinook.sharpdata</a></strong></li>
</ul>

Or via command-line:
```
$ app open sharpdata mix northwind.sharpdata
$ app open sharpdata mix chinook.sharpdata
```

Cross platform using the [x dotnet tool](/dotnet-tool) (in Default Browser):
```
$ x open sharpdata mix northwind.sharpdata
$ x open sharpdata mix chinook.sharpdata
```
Each of these options will download & run the latest version of [SharpData](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/SharpData) along with a 
copy of the [northwind.sharpdata](https://gist.github.com/gistlyn/0ce0d5b828303f1cb4637450b563adbd) or 
[chinook.sharpdata](https://gist.github.com/gistlyn/96b10369daf94897531810841cb097f2) gists on-the-fly containing the embedded SQLite DB along with any
UI customizations.

#### Hosted as a .NET Core App

As [NetCoreApps/SharpData](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/SharpData) is also a standard .NET Core project, it can also be deployed as a 
normal stand-alone .NET Core Web App:

### [https://sharpdata.netcore.io](https://sharpdata.netcore.io)

### Tiny footprint

An impressively capable .NET Core App that fits into a tiny **20kb .zip** footprint thanks to [Gist Desktop App's Architecture](https://sharpscript.net/sharp-apps/gist-desktop-apps). It's small dynamic `#Script` & Vue TypeScript code-base also makes it highly customizable to tailor & further extend with 
App-specific requirements - suitable for offering advanced system users a quick, capable customized read-only UI of your DBs.

**SharpData** started as a demonstration showing how productive [#Script](https://sharpscript.net) can be in the number of areas where 
dynamic languages offer far superior productivity then the typical .NET approach of using C# to type an entire code-base & models.

For example a single `#Script` page provides a lot of the functionality in [AutoQuery](/autoquery/rdbms) where it provides an instant HTTP API 
(in all registered ServiceStack formats) around all registered RDBMS tables, in all OrmLite supported RBDMS's, that includes support for custom fields, 
multiple querying options, paging, multi OrderBy's in a parameterized SQL query executed with OrmLite's SQL async DB APIs:

### AutoQuery Script

The `_` prefixes in the path utilizes [Page Based Routing](https://sharpscript.net/docs/script-pages#page-based-routing) allowing for 
[CoC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration) based 
[Clean URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_URL) routes without needing to define & maintain separate routes where the
same script supports querying all [registered multitenancy databases](/multitenancy#changedb-apphost-registration).

### Instant Customizable RDBMS UI

The [SharpData](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/SharpData) project essentially provides a UI around this script, surfacing its features & give 
it instant utility which ended up being so useful that it's become the quickest way to perform fast adhoc DB queries as it's easy to configure 
which RDBMS's & tables to show in a simple text file, easy to customize its UI, enables 1-click export into Excel and its shortcut syntax
support in column filters is a fast way to perform quick adhoc queries.

### Quick Tour

We'll quickly go through some of its features to give you an idea of its capabilities, from the above screenshot we can some of its 
filtering capabilities. All results displayed in the UI are queried using the above
[sharpdata](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/SharpData/blob/master/wwwroot/db/_db/_table/index.html) `#Script` HTTP API 
which supports the following features:

#### Filters

All query string parameter except for `db,fields,format,skip,take,orderBy` are treated as filters, where you can:

  - Use `=null` or `!=null` to search `NULL` columns
  - Use `<=`, `<`, `>`, `>=`, `<>`, `!=` prefix to search with that operator
  - Use `,` trailing comma to perform an `IN (values)` search (integer columns only)
  - Use `%` suffix or prefix to perform a `LIKE` search
  - Use `=` prefix to perform a coerced "JS" search, for exact `number`, `boolean`, `null` and WCF date comparisons
  - Otherwise by default performs a "string equality" search where columns are casted and compared as strings

Here's the filtered list used in the above screenshot:

  [/db/main/Order?Id=>10200&CustomerId=V%&Freight=<=30&OrderDate=>1997-01-01](http://sharpdata.netcore.io/db/main/Order?format=json&Id=%3E10200&CustomerId=V%25&Freight=%3C%3D30&OrderDate=%3E1997-01-01&take=100)

#### Custom Field Selection

The **column selection** icon on the top left of the results lets you query custom select columns which is specified using `?fields`:

  - [/db/main/Customer?fields=Id,CompanyName,ContactName,ContactTitle](https://sharpdata.netcore.io/db/main/Customer?format=json&fields=Id%2CCompanyName%2CContactName%2CContactTitle&take=100)

#### Multiple OrderBy's

You can use [AutoQuery Syntax](/autoquery/rdbms#multiple-orderbys) to specify multiple Order By's:

  - [/db/main/Customer?orderBy=-Id,CompanyName,-ContactName](https://sharpdata.netcore.io/db/main/Customer?format=json&orderBy=-Id,CompanyName,-ContactName)

#### Paging

Use `?skip` and `?take` to page through a result set

#### Format

Use `?format` to specify which **Content-Type** to return the results in, e.g:

  - [/db/main/Customer?format=html](https://sharpdata.netcore.io/db/main/Customer?format=html)
  - [/db/main/Customer?format=json](https://sharpdata.netcore.io/db/main/Customer?format=json)
  - [/db/main/Customer?format=csv](https://sharpdata.netcore.io/db/main/Customer?format=csv)

#### Multitenancy

You can specify which registered DB to search using the path info, use `main` to query the default database:

    /db/<named-db>/<table>

### Launching SharpData

To run SharpData in a .NET Core Desktop App you'll need latest `app` dotnet tool:

    $ dotnet tool update -g app

> If on macOS/Linux you can use the [x dotnet tool](/dotnet-tool) instead to view SharpData in your default browser

#### Configure RDBMS from command-line

You can override which database to connect to by specifying it on the command line, e.g. here's an example of connecting to https://techstacks.io RDBMS:

    $ app open sharpdata -db postgres -db.connection $TECHSTACKS_DB

Which will open SharpData listing all of TechStack's RDBMS tables. If you have a lot of tables the **Sidebar filter** provides a quick way to
find the table you want, e.g:

![](/img/pages/release-notes/v5.9/sharpdata-technology.png) 

### app URL Schemes

What can be done with the `open` command on the command-line can also be done from a **custom URL Scheme**, a feature that opens up a myriad of new 
possibilities as `app` can open [Gist Desktop Apps](https://sharpscript.net/docs/gist-desktop-apps) from Gists or in public & private GitHub repositories, 
where it's able to download and launch Apps on the fly with custom arguments - allowing a single URL to run a **never installed** Desktop App stored in a 
Gist & pass it custom params to enable **deep linking**.

With this organizations could maintain a dashboard of links to its different Desktop Apps that anyone can access, especially useful as the 
**only software** that's needed to run any [Sharp Apps](https://sharpscript.net/docs/sharp-apps) is the `app` dotnet tool which thanks to all 
ServiceStack .dll's & dependencies being bundled with the tool, (including Vue/React/Bootstrap fontawesome and Material SVG Icon assets), 
the only files that need to be published are the App's specific resources, which is how Apps like **SharpData** can be compressed in a 
**20kb .zip** - a tiny payload that's viable to download the latest app each on each run, removing the pain & friction to distribute updates as 
everyone's already running the latest version every time it's run.

Should you need to (e.g. large Sharp App or github.com is down) you can run your previously locally cached App using `run`:

    $ app run sharpdata

With Custom URL Schemes everyone with `app` installed can view any database they have network access to from specifying the db type and connection string in the URL:

    app://sharpdata?db=postgres&db.connection={CONNECTION_STRING}

> CONNECTION_STRING needs to be URL Encoded, e.g. with JS's `encodeURIComponent()`

or by specifying an Environment variable containing the connection string:

    app://sharpdata?db=postgres&db.connection=$TECHSTACKS_DB

In addition to Sharp Apps being downloaded and run on the fly, they're also able to take advantage of the dotnet tools [mix support](/mix-tool) to 
also download another Gist's content into the Sharp App's working directory.

With this you can publish a custom dataset in an SQLite database save it as a gist and **generate a single URL** that everyone can use to 
download the database and open it in **SharpData**, e.g:

<ul><li><a href="app://sharpdata?mix=northwind.sqlite&amp;db=sqlite&amp;db.connection=northwind.sqlite">app://sharpdata?mix=northwind.sqlite&amp;db=sqlite&amp;db.connection=northwind.sqlite</a></li></ul>

It's possible to use the user-friendly `northwind.sqlite` alias here as it's published in the global [mix.md](https://gist.github.com/gistlyn/9b32b03f207a191099137429051ebde8) directory where it links to the [northwind.sqlite gist](https://gist.github.com/gistlyn/97d0bcd3ebd582e06c85f8400683e037). 

For your custom databases you use the **Gist Id** instead or if you plan to use this feature a lot you can override which `mix.md` document that 
`app` should source its links from by specifying another **Gist Id** in the `MIX_SOURCE` Environment variable (or see below - to create a local alias).

But if you're already mixing in an external gist you may as well include a custom `app.settings` in the Gist so it's pre-configured with custom 
RDBMS registrations and table lists, e.g:

<ul><li><a href="app://sharpdata?mix=northwind.sharpdata">app://sharpdata?mix=northwind.sharpdata</a></li></ul>

Which applies the [northwind.sharpdata gist](https://gist.github.com/gistlyn/0ce0d5b828303f1cb4637450b563adbd), which can also be referenced by **Gist Id**:

<ul><li><a href="app://sharpdata?mix=0ce0d5b828303f1cb4637450b563adbd">app://sharpdata?mix=0ce0d5b828303f1cb4637450b563adbd</a></li></ul>

Alternatively you may instead prefer to publish it to a private GitHub repo instead of a Gist which anyone can open up with:

    app://user/sharpdata-private?token={TOKEN}

The `app` dotnet tools will use the **latest published GitHub release** if there are any, otherwise will use the **master.zip** archive, 
this feature can be used to maintain a working master repo and maintain control ver when to publish new versions of your custom SharpData App.

### app local aliases

Where ever you can use a Gist Id, you can assign a local user-friendly alias to use instead. So if you had a custom **sqlite** database and 
sharpdata **app.settings** you could assign it to a local **db** alias with:

    $ app alias db 0ce0d5b828303f1cb4637450b563adbd

Which you'll be able to use in place of the Gist Id, e.g. via command-line:

    $ app open sharpdata mix db

or via URL Scheme:

    app://sharpdata?mix=db

Likewise the gist alias can also be used for referencing [Gist Desktop Apps](https://sharpscript.net/docs/gist-desktop-apps), e.g. we can assign the 
[redis gist app](https://gist.github.com/gistlyn/6de7993333b457445793f51f6f520ea8) to use our preferred alias:

    $ app alias local-redis 6de7993333b457445793f51f6f520ea8

That we can open via command-line:

    $ app open local-redis

Or URL Scheme:

    app://local-redis

Or if we want to run our own modified copy of the Redis Desktop App, we can [mix](/mix-tool) the Gist files to our
local directory:

    $ app mix local-redis

Make the changes we want, then run our local copy by running `app` (or `x`) without arguments:

    $ app

Other alias command include:

##### View all aliases

    $ app alias

##### View single alias

    $ app alias mydb

##### Remove an alias

    $ app unalias mydb

### Open in Excel

SharpData detects if **Excel** is installed and lets you open the un-paged filtered resultset directly by clicking the **Excel** button

![](/img/pages/release-notes/v5.9/sharpdata-excel.png) 

This works seamlessly as it's able to "by-pass" the browser download where the query is performed by the back-end .NET Core Server who streams the response directly to the Users **Downloads** folder and launches it in Excel as soon as it's finished.

### Custom SharpData UI

Each time a Gist Desktop App is opened it downloads and overrides the existing Gist with the latest version which it loads in a [Gist VFS](/virtual-file-system#gistvirtualfiles) where any of its files can be overridden with a local copy.

As the App's working directory is preserved between restarts you can provide a custom `app.settings` at:

    %USERPROFILE%\.sharp-apps\sharpdata\app.settings

#### Custom app.settings

Where you can perform basic customizations like which RDBMS's and tables you want to be able to access, e.g:

```
debug false
name Northwind & TechStacks UI
appName sharpdata

db.connections[northwind]  { db:sqlite,   connection:'northwind.sqlite' }
db.connections[techstacks] { db:postgres, connection:$TECHSTACKS_DB }

args.tables Customer,Order,OrderDetail,Category,Product,Employee,EmployeeTerritory,Shipper,Supplier,Region,Territory
args.tables_techstacks technology,technology_stack,technology_choice,organization,organization_member,post,post_comment,post_vote,custom_user_auth,user_auth_details,user_activity,page_stats
```

Which will display both RDBMS Databases, showing only the user-specified tables in app.settings above:

![](/img/pages/release-notes/v5.9/sharpdata-custom-appsettings.png) 

### Advanced Customizations

More advanced customizations can be added via dropping TypeScript/JavaScript source files in the `/custom` folder, e.g:

 - [/wwwroot/custom/chinook.ts](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/SharpData/blob/master/wwwroot/custom/chinook.ts)
 - [/wwwroot/custom/northwind.ts](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/SharpData/blob/master/wwwroot/custom/northwind.ts)

Which is how the [northwind.sharpdata](https://gist.github.com/gistlyn/0ce0d5b828303f1cb4637450b563adbd) and 
[chinook.sharpdata](https://gist.github.com/gistlyn/96b10369daf94897531810841cb097f2) mix gists enable Customized Views for the Northwind
& Chinook databases via their dbConfig registrations below:

#### chinook

```ts
dbConfig('chinook', {
    showTables: 'albums,artists,playlists,tracks,genres,media_types,customers,employees,invoices'.split(','),
    tableName: splitPascalCase,
    links: {
        albums: {
            ArtistId: (id:number) => `artists?filter=ArtistId:${id}`
        },
        employees: {
            ReportsTo: (id:number) => `employees?filter=EmployeeId:${id}`
        },
        invoices: {
            CustomerId: (id:number) => `customers?filter=CustomerId:${id}`
        },
        tracks: {
            AlbumId: (id:number) => `albums?filter=AlbumId:${id}`,
            MediaTypeId: (id:number) => `media_types?filter=MediaTypeId:${id}`,
            GenreId: (id:number) => `genres?filter=GenreId:${id}`,
        }
    },
    rowComponents: {
        albums: Album,
        artists: Artist,
        playlists: Playlist,
    }
});
```

#### northwind

```ts
dbConfig('northwind', {
    showTables: 'Customer,Order,OrderDetail,Category,Product,Employee,Shipper,Supplier,Region'.split(','),
    tableName: splitPascalCase,
    links: {
        Order: {
            CustomerId: (id:string) => `Customer?filter=Id:${id}`,
            EmployeeId: (id:string) => `Employee?filter=Id:${id}`,
            ShipVia: (id:number) => `Shipper?filter=Id:${id}`,
        },
        OrderDetail: {
            OrderId: (id:string) => `Order?filter=Id:${id}`,
            ProductId: (id:string) => `Product?filter=Id:${id}`,
        },
        Product: {
            SupplierId: (id:number) => `Supplier?filter=Id:${id}`,
            CategoryId: (id:number) => `Category?filter=Id:${id}`,
        },
        Territory: {
            RegionId: (id:number) => `Region?filter=Id:${id}`,
        },
    },
    rowComponents: {
        Order,
        Customer,
    }
});
```

These db customizations let you specify which RDBMS tables & the order that they should be displayed, the table names text casing function, 
which columns to linkify & any custom Row Components for different tables.

### Deploying Customizations

When deploying as a .NET Core project the customizations are deployed with your [/wwwroot](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/SharpData/tree/master/wwwroot) 
as normal.

To make customizations available to load with the SharpData Gist Desktop App you'll need to publish the directory of customizations to a gist.
Here are the customizations for the [northwind.sharpdata](https://gist.github.com/gistlyn/0ce0d5b828303f1cb4637450b563adbd) and 
[chinook.sharpdata](https://gist.github.com/gistlyn/96b10369daf94897531810841cb097f2) gists:

### [/dist-mix](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/SharpData/tree/master/dist-mix)
 - [/chinook](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/SharpData/tree/master/dist-mix/chinook)
    - [/custom](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/SharpData/tree/master/dist-mix/chinook/custom)
        - [chinook.js](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/SharpData/blob/master/dist-mix/chinook/custom/chinook.js) - UI Customizations

    - [northwind.sqlite](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/SharpData/blob/master/dist-mix/northwind/northwind.sqlite) - Embedded SQLite database

You can [publish a directory of files to a GitHub Gist](https://sharpscript.net/sharp-apps/app-index#publishing-gist-desktop-apps) using the `x publish` command with the 
GitHub **AccessToken** with gist write access you want to write to, e.g:

    $ cd northwind
    $ x publish -token %TOKEN%

### Viewing Customizations

When published these Gist Customizations can be viewed by gist id directly or by a user friendly gist mix or local alias:

<ul>
    <li><strong><a name="app://sharpdata?mix=0ce0d5b828303f1cb4637450b563adbd">app://sharpdata?mix=0ce0d5b828303f1cb4637450b563adbd</a></strong></li>
    <li><strong><a name="app://sharpdata?mix=96b10369daf94897531810841cb097f2">app://sharpdata?mix=96b10369daf94897531810841cb097f2</a></strong></li>
</ul>

### Custom Row Components

Whilst a tabular grid view might be a natural UI for browsing a database for devs, we can do better since we have the full UI source code of the Vue components. 
A filtered tabular view makes it fast to find the record you're interested in, but it's not ideal for quickly finding related information about an Entity.

To provide a more customized UX for different App UIs, **SharpData** includes support for **"Row Components"** 
(defined in [/wwwroot/custom](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/SharpData/tree/master/wwwroot/custom)) to be able to quickly drill down & view 
richer info on any record.

For example when viewing an **Order**, it's natural to want to view the **Order Details** with it, enabled with the custom Vue component registration below:

```ts
@Component({ template:
`<div v-if="id">
    <jsonviewer :value="details" />
</div>
<div v-else class="alert alert-danger">Order Id needs to be selected</div>`
})
class Order extends RowComponent {
    details:any[] = [];

    get id() { return this.row.Id; }

    async mounted() {
        this.details = await sharpData(this.db,'OrderDetail',{ OrderId: this.id });
    }
}
```

All Row components are injected with the `db`, `table` properties, the entire `row` object that was selected as well as the Column Schema definition for that table. Inside the component you're free to display anything, in this case we're using the `sharpData` helper for calling the server `#Script` HTTP API to get it to fetch all `OrderDetail` entries for this order.

> If the resultset is filtered without the Order `Id` PK it can't fetch its referenced data, so displays an error instead

The [jsonviewer](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/SharpData/blob/master/src/JsonViewer.ts) component used is similar to ServiceStack's 
[HTML5 auto pages](/html5reportformat) to quickly view contents of any object.

The `registerRowComponent(db,table,VueComponent,componentName)` API is used to register this component with **SharpData** to make it available to render any order.

With the `Order` component registered we can now drill down into any **Order** to view its **Order Details**:

![](/img/pages/release-notes/v5.9/sharpdata-custom-rowcomponents.png) 

You're free to render any kind of UI in the row component, e.g. here's the [Customer.ts](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/SharpData/blob/master/src/components/Custom/Customer.ts) row component used to render a richer view for Customers:

```ts
@Component({ template:
`<div v-if="id" class="pl-2">
    <h3 class="text-success">{{customer.ContactName}}</h3>
    <table class="table table-bordered" style="width:auto">
        <tr>
            <th>Contact</th>
            <td>{{ customer.ContactName }} ({{ customer.ContactTitle }})</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Address</th>
            <td>
                <div>{{ customer.Address }}</div>
                <div>{{ customer.City }}, {{ customer.PostalCode }}, {{ customer.Country }}</div>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Phone</th>
            <td>{{ customer.Phone }}</td>
        </tr>
        <tr v-if="customer.Fax">
            <th>Fax</th>
            <td>{{ customer.Fax }}</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <jsonviewer :value="orders" />
</div>
<div v-else class="alert alert-danger">Customer Id needs to be selected</div>`
})
class Customer extends RowComponent {

    customer:any = null;
    orders:any[] = [];

    get id() { return this.row.Id; }

    async mounted() {
        this.customer = (await sharpData(this.db,this.table,{ Id: this.id }))[0];
        const fields = 'Id,EmployeeId,OrderDate,Freight,ShipVia,ShipCity,ShipCountry';
        this.orders = await sharpData(this.db,'Order',{ CustomerId: this.id, fields })
    }
}
```

Which looks like:

![](/img/pages/release-notes/v5.9/sharpdata-customer-rowcomponent.png) 

### SharpData .NET Core Project

Whilst [NetCoreApps/SharpData](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/SharpData) can live a charmed life as a Desktop App, it's also just a regular ServiceStack .NET Core App with a [Startup.cs](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/SharpData/blob/master/Startup.cs) and `AppHost` that can be developed, published and deployed as you're used to, here's an instance of it [deployed as a .NET Core App on Linux](/netcore-deploy-rsync):

### [sharpdata.netcore.io](https://sharpdata.netcore.io)

> For best experience we recommend running against local network databases

It's a unique ServiceStack App in that it doesn't contain any ServiceStack Services as it's only using pre-existing functionality already built into ServiceStack, 
`#Script` for its HTTP APIs and a Vue SPA for its UI, so requires no `.dll's` need to be deployed with it.

It uses the same Vue SPA solution as [vue-lite](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/vue-lite) to avoid npm's size & complexity where you only need to run TypeScript's `tsc -w` to enable its [live-reload](/hot-reloading) dev UX which provides its instant feedback during development.

Some other of its unique traits is that instead of manually including all the Vue framework `.js` libraries, it instead references the new `ServiceStack.Desktop.dll` for its Vue framework libraries and its Material design SVG icons which are [referenced as normal file references](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/SharpData/blob/0499e7c66ca4289d17158e79bcc91815bbcd7a99/wwwroot/_layout.html#L60-L66):

::: v-pre
```js
{{ [
    `/lib/js/vue/vue.min.js`,
    `/lib/js/vue-router/vue-router.min.js`,
    `/lib/js/vue-class-component/vue-class-component.min.js`,
    `/lib/js/vue-property-decorator/vue-property-decorator.min.js`,
    `/lib/js/@servicestack/desktop/servicestack-desktop.min.js`,
    `/lib/js/@servicestack/client/servicestack-client.min.js`,
    `/lib/js/@servicestack/vue/servicestack-vue.min.js`,
] |> map => `<script src="${it}"></script>` |> joinln |> raw }}
```
:::

But instead of needing to exist on disk & deployed with your project it's referencing the embedded resources in `ServiceStack.Desktop.dll` and only the bundled assets need to be [deployed with your project](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/SharpData/blob/0499e7c66ca4289d17158e79bcc91815bbcd7a99/SharpData.csproj#L17) which is using the built-in [NUglify](https://github.com/xoofx/NUglify) support in the [dotnet tools](/dotnet-tool) to produce its highly optimized/minified bundle without needing to rely on any npm tooling when publishing the .NET Core App:

```xml
<Target Name="Bundle" BeforeTargets="AfterPublish">
    <Exec Command="x run _bundle.ss -to /bin/Release/netcoreapp3.1/publish/wwwroot" />
</Target>
```

The included [/typings](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/SharpData/tree/master/typings) are just the TypeScript definitions for each library which 
TypeScript uses for its static analysis & its great dev UX in IDEs & VSCode, but are only needed during development and not deployed with the project.

### Publish to Gist Desktop App

The primary way **SharpData** is distributed is as a [Gist Desktop App](https://sharpscript.net/docs/gist-desktop-apps), where it's able to provide instant utility by running on a users local machine inside a native Chromium Desktop App making it suitable for a much broader use-case as a fast, lightweight, always up-to-date Desktop App with deeper Windows integration all packaged in a tiny **20kb .zip** footprint. There's no need to provision servers, setup CI, manage cloud hosting resources, you can simply run a script to update a Gist where its latest features are immediately available to your end users the next time it's run.

To run, test & publish it as a Desktop App you can use the pre-made scripts in [package.json](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/SharpData/blob/master/package.json).
Rider provides a nice UX here as it lets you run each individual script directly from their json editor:

![](/img/pages/release-notes/v5.9/sharpdata-scripts.png) 

Essentially to package it into a [Sharp App](https://sharpscript.net/docs/sharp-apps) you just need to run the `pack` script which will bundle & copy all required assets into the `/dist` folder which you can then test locally in a [.NET Core Desktop App](/netcore-windows-desktop) by running `app` in that folder:

    $ cd dist
    $ app

The `init-test` script just copies an example **northwind.sqlite** database and sample `app.settings` so you have something to test it with if you need it.

The `publish-app` script is if you want to publish it to a Gist, you will need it to provide the GitHub **AccessToken** with write access to the Gist User Account you want to publish it to. Adding an `appName` and `description` to `app.settings` will publish it to the [Global App Registry](https://sharpscript.net/docs/gist-desktop-apps#instant-run-without-installation), make it publicly discoverable and allow anyone to open your App using your user-friendly `appName` alias, otherwise they can run it using the **Gist Id** or **Gist URL**.

Alternatively the contents of the `dist/` folder can be published to a GitHub repo (public or private) and run with:

    $ app open <user>/<repo>

Or link to it with its custom URL Scheme:

    app://<user>/repo

If it's in a private repo they'll need to either provide an **AccessToken** in the `GITHUB_TOKEN` Environment variable or using the `-token` argument:

    $ app open <user>/<repo> -token <token>

URL Scheme:

    app://<user>/repo?token=<token>

### RDBMS Configuration

When running as a .NET Core App you'd need to register which RDBMS's you want to use with OrmLite's configuration, e.g. the screenshot above registers an SQLite `northwind.sqlite` database and the https://techstacks.io PostgreSQL Database:

```csharp
container.Register<IDbConnectionFactory>(c => new OrmLiteConnectionFactory(
    MapProjectPath("~/northwind.sqlite"), SqliteDialect.Provider));

var dbFactory = container.Resolve<IDbConnectionFactory>();
dbFactory.RegisterConnection("techstacks",
     Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("TECHSTACKS_DB"),
     PostgreSqlDialect.Provider);
```

By default it shows all Tables in each RDBMS, but you can limit it to only show a user-defined list of tables with `#Script` Arguments:

```csharp
Plugins.Add(new SharpPagesFeature {
    //...
    Args = {
        //Only display user-defined list of tables:
        ["tables"] = "Customer,Order,OrderDetail,Category,Product,Employee,EmployeeTerritory,Shipper,Supplier,Region,Territory",
        ["tables_techstacks"] = "technology,technology_stack,technology_choice,organization,organization_member,post,post_comment,post_vote,custom_user_auth,user_auth_details,user_activity,page_stats",
    }
});
```

When running as a Sharp App it's instead configured in its 
[app.settings](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/SharpData/blob/master/scripts/deploy/app.northwind.settings), here's equivalent settings for the above configuration:

```
# Configure below. Supported dialects: sqlite, mysql, postgres, sqlserver
db sqlite
db.connection northwind.sqlite
# db.connections[techstacks] { db:postgres, connection:$TECHSTACKS_DB }

args.tables Customer,Order,OrderDetail,Category,Product,Employee,EmployeeTerritory,Shipper,Supplier,Region,Territory
args.tables_techstacks technology,technology_stack,technology_choice,organization,organization_member,post,post_comment,post_vote,custom_user_auth,user_auth_details,user_activity,page_stats
```

### Feedback

We hope [SharpData](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/SharpData) serves useful in some capacity, whether it's being able to quickly develop and Ship a UI to stakeholders or as a template to develop .NET Core Apps that you can distribute as **Sharp Apps**, as an example to explore the delivery and platform potential of URL schemes and install-less Desktop Apps or just as an inspiration for areas where `#Script` shines & the different kind of Apps you can create with it. 

Whilst `app` is Windows 64 only, you can use the `x` cross-platform tool and its `xapp://` URL scheme to run Sharp Apps on macOS/Linux, it just wont have access to any of its Window Integration features.

## AutoQuery CRUD!

AutoQuery Services enjoy new declarative super powers where it's able to implement much of a CRUD Services logic declaratively,
including support for multi-tenancy, optimistic concurrency, declarative validation, Auto Mapping external of Request/Respond DTOs 
to data model properties, auto populating then using full #Script Expressions that can be used for example to populate timestamps, 
authenticating user information, generating new UUIDs, etc.

Just like AutoQuery, CRUD Services are ServiceStack Services where you can continue using the same functionality to 
specify optimal user-defined routes for HTTP APIs, same Request/Response and Attribute filters to apply custom logic and 
continue enjoying the entire ecosystem around ServiceStack Services including being able to invoke them via 
[gRPC](/grpc/), [MQ endpoints](/messaging) and its rich client ecosystem for enabling end-to-end Typed APIs with 
[Add ServiceStack Reference](/add-servicestack-reference).

AutoQuery Services are fast & emit clean optimal "pure serialized POCO" wire-format, they're built on OrmLite's high-performance 
APIs where all AutoQuery APIs are `async` by default but also also offers native sync APIs if needing to enlist any of
AutoQuery's functionality in custom sync methods (that are unable to be converted into viral async APIs).

Importantly AutoQuery Services are "future-proofed" and can be overridden with a custom implementation that can either choose to augment 
the existing AutoQuery functionality and enhance it with custom behavior (e.g. if not possible to implement declaratively) or if needed its 
entire implementation can be replaced without breaking its design contract & existing client integrations, should it be necessary to
reimplement later if the Service needs to be constructed to use alternative data sources.

### Limitations of typical Auto querying Solutions

This is ultimately where many auto querying solutions fall down, they're typically executed with black-box binary implementations which 
only understand their opaque query languages normal Services wouldn't support, are exposed on unnatural routes you wouldn't use 
and return unclean verbose wire formats normal Services wouldn't return. So when it comes to needing to replace their 
implementation-specific APIs, it's often not feasible to reverse engineer a new implementation to match its existing Services contract and 
would need to resort in creating a new incompatible API, breaking existing clients and violating its Systems encapsulation which 
should be one of the [core goals of Service design](/service-complexity-and-dto-roles#services).

### Creating AutoQuery CRUD Services

Just like [AutoQuery](/autoquery/rdbms), you just need to provide the typed Request DTOs definition for your DB Table APIs and 
AutoQuery automatically provides the implementation for the Service. 

To enlist Auto CRUD behavior your Request DTOs need to implement one of the following interfaces which dictates the behavior of the Service:

  - `ICreateDb<Table>` - Create new Table Entry
  - `IUpdateDb<Table>` - Update existing Table Entry 
  - `IPatchDb<Table>`  - Partially update existing Table Entry 
  - `IDeleteDb<Table>` - Delete existing Table Entry 

All Request DTOs also require either an `IReturn<T>` or `IReturnVoid` marker interface to specify the return type of the Service. 

> Can use built-in `IReturn<EmptyResponse>` for an "empty" response where as `IReturnVoid` returns "no" response.

Let's go through a simple example, starting with a simple POCO OrmLite data model we want to add to our RDBMS:

```csharp
public class Rockstar
{
    [AutoIncrement]
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }
    public int? Age { get; set; }
    public DateTime DateOfBirth { get; set; }
    public DateTime? DateDied { get; set; }
    public LivingStatus LivingStatus { get; set; }
}
```

We can create a Service that inserts new `Rockstar` by defining all the properties we want to allow API consumers to provide when creating a new Rockstar:

```csharp
public class CreateRockstar : ICreateDb<Rockstar>, IReturn<CreateRockstarResponse> 
{
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }
    public int? Age { get; set; }
    public DateTime DateOfBirth { get; set; }
}

public class CreateRockstarResponse
{
    public int Id { get; set; } // Id is auto populated with RDBMS generated Id
    public ResponseStatus ResponseStatus { get; set; }
}
```

When ServiceStack starts it generates the implementation for this Service, which can now insert Rockstars using your populated Request DTO:

```csharp
var client = new JsonServiceClient(baseUrl);

client.Post(new CreateRockstar {
    FirstName = "Kurt",
    LastName = "Cobain",
    Age = 27,
    DateOfBirth = new DateTime(20,2,1967),
});
```

Similarly you can define "Update" and "Delete" Services the same way, e.g:

```csharp
public class UpdateRockstar : Rockstar,
    IUpdateDb<Rockstar>, IReturn<UpdateRockstarResponse> {}

public class UpdateRockstarResponse
{
    public int Id { get; set; } // Id is auto populated with RDBMS generated Id
    public Rockstar Result { get; set; } // selects & returns latest DB Rockstar
    public ResponseStatus ResponseStatus { get; set; }
}
```

By convention if your Response DTO contains any of these properties it will be automatically populated:

 - `T Id` - The Primary Key
 - `T Result` - The POCO you want to return (can be a subset of DB model)
 - `int Count` - Return the number of rows affected (Deletes can have >1)

Delete Services need only a Primary Key, e.g:

```csharp
public class DeleteRockstar : IDeleteDb<Rockstar>, IReturnVoid 
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
}
```

and to Query the Rockstar table you have the [full featureset of AutoQuery](/autoquery/rdbms) for a complete set of CRUD Services without needing to provide any implementations.

### Advanced CRUD Example

Lets now explore a more advanced example that implements Audit information as well as layered support for multi-tenancy to see how you can easily compose features.

So lets say you have an interface that all tables you want to contain Audit information implements:

```csharp
public interface IAudit 
{
    DateTime CreatedDate { get; set; }
    string CreatedBy { get; set; }
    string CreatedInfo { get; set; }
    DateTime ModifiedDate { get; set; }
    string ModifiedBy { get; set; }
    string ModifiedInfo { get; set; }
    DateTime? SoftDeletedDate { get; set; }
    string SoftDeletedBy { get; set; }
    string SoftDeletedInfo { get; set; }
}
```

It's not required, but it's also useful to have a concrete base table which could be annotated like:

```csharp
public abstract class AuditBase : IAudit
{
    public DateTime CreatedDate { get; set; }
    [Required]
    public string CreatedBy { get; set; }
    [Required]
    public string CreatedInfo { get; set; }

    public DateTime ModifiedDate { get; set; }
    [Required]
    public string ModifiedBy { get; set; }
    [Required]
    public string ModifiedInfo { get; set; }

    [Index] //Check if Deleted
    public DateTime? SoftDeletedDate { get; set; }
    public string SoftDeletedBy { get; set; }
    public string SoftDeletedInfo { get; set; }
}
```

We can then create a base Request DTO that all Audit Create Services will implement:

```csharp
[ValidateIsAuthenticated]
[AutoPopulate(nameof(IAudit.CreatedDate),  Eval = "utcNow")]
[AutoPopulate(nameof(IAudit.CreatedBy),    Eval = "userAuthName")] //or userAuthId
[AutoPopulate(nameof(IAudit.CreatedInfo),  Eval = "`${userSession.DisplayName} (${userSession.City})`")]
[AutoPopulate(nameof(IAudit.ModifiedDate), Eval = "utcNow")]
[AutoPopulate(nameof(IAudit.ModifiedBy),   Eval = "userAuthName")] //or userAuthId
[AutoPopulate(nameof(IAudit.ModifiedInfo), Eval = "`${userSession.DisplayName} (${userSession.City})`")]
public abstract class CreateAuditBase<Table,TResponse> : ICreateDb<Table>, IReturn<TResponse> {}
```
These all call [#Script Methods](https://sharpscript.net/docs/methods) which you can [add/extend yourself](https://sharpscript.net/docs/script-pages#extend).

The `*Info` examples is a superfluous example showing that you can basically evaluate any `#Script` expression. Typically you'd only save User Id or Username

### AutoPopulate

The `[AutoPopulate]` attribute tells AutoCrud that you want the DB Table to automatically populate these properties, which can be populated using any of its
properties below:

 - **Value** - A constant value that can be used in C# Attributes, e.g `Value="Foo"`
 - **Expression** - A Lightweight [#Script](https://sharpscript.net/) Expression that results in a constant value that's only evaluated once and cached globally, e.g. `Expression = "date(2001,1,1)"`, useful for values that can't be defined in C# Attributes like `DateTime`, can be any [#Script Method](https://sharpscript.net/docs/default-scripts).
 - **Eval** - A [#Script](https://sharpscript.net/) Expression that's cached per request. E.g. `Eval="utcNow"` calls the `utcNow` Script method which returns `DateTime.UtcNow` which is cached for that request so all other `utcNow` expressions will return the same exact value. 
 - **NoCache** - Don't cache the expression, evaluate it each time.

AutoCrud makes extensive usage of `#Script` expressions for much of its declarative functionality which always executes their cached ASTs so expressions are only parsed once and still fast to evaluate even when results are not cached.

Lets now layer on additional generic functionality by inheriting and extending the base class with additional functionality, e.g. if we want our table to support [Multitenancy](/multitenancy) we could extend it with:

```csharp
[AutoPopulate(nameof(IAuditTenant.TenantId), Eval = "Request.Items.TenantId")]
public abstract class CreateAuditTenantBase<Table,TResponse> 
    : CreateAuditBase<Table,TResponse> {}
```

Where `TenantId` is added in a Global Request Filter (e.g. after inspecting the authenticated UserSession to determine the tenant they belong to), e.g:

```csharp
const string TenantId = nameof(TenantId);

void SetTenant(IRequest req, IResponse res, object dto)
{
    var userSession = req.SessionAs<AuthUserSession>();
    if (userSession.IsAuthenticated)
    {
        req.SetItem(TenantId, userSession.City switch {
            "London" => 10,
            "Perth"  => 11,
            //...
            _        => 100,
        });
    }
}
    
GlobalRequestFilters.Add(SetTenant);        // HTTP Requests
GlobalMessageRequestFilters.Add(SetTenant); // MQ Requests
```

Now we easily implement custom "Audited" and "Multi Tenant" CRUD Services by inheriting these base Services. 

Here's an example of our custom Table that implements our `AuditBase` class with a `TenantId` to capture the Tenant the record should be saved to:

```csharp
public class RockstarAuditTenant : AuditBase
{
    [Index]
    public int TenantId { get; set; }
    [AutoIncrement]
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }
    public int? Age { get; set; }
    public DateTime DateOfBirth { get; set; }
    public DateTime? DateDied { get; set; }
    public LivingStatus LivingStatus { get; set; }
}
```

Our service can now implement our base Audit & Multitenant enabled service:

```csharp
public class CreateRockstarAuditTenant 
    : CreateAuditTenantBase<RockstarAuditTenant, CreateRockstarResponse>
{
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }
    public int? Age { get; set; }
    public DateTime DateOfBirth { get; set; }
}
```

And all the decorated properties will be automatically populated when creating the Rockstar with `CreateRockstarAuditTenant`, e.g:

```csharp
client.Post(new CreateRockstarAuditTenant {
    FirstName = "Kurt",
    LastName = "Cobain",
    Age = 27,
    DateOfBirth = new DateTime(20,2,1967),
});
```

We can create the same base classes for Updates:

```csharp
[ValidateIsAuthenticated]
[AutoPopulate(nameof(IAudit.ModifiedDate), Eval = "utcNow")]
[AutoPopulate(nameof(IAudit.ModifiedBy),   Eval = "userAuthName")] //or userAuthId
[AutoPopulate(nameof(IAudit.ModifiedInfo), Eval = "`${userSession.DisplayName} (${userSession.City})`")]
public abstract class UpdateAuditBase<Table,TResponse> 
    : IUpdateDb<Table>, IReturn<TResponse> {}

[AutoFilter(nameof(IAuditTenant.TenantId), Eval="Request.Items.TenantId")]
public abstract class UpdateAuditTenantBase<Table,TResponse> 
    : UpdateAuditBase<Table,TResponse> {}

public class UpdateRockstarAuditTenant 
    : UpdateAuditTenantBase<RockstarAuditTenant, RockstarWithIdResponse>
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public LivingStatus? LivingStatus { get; set; }
}
```

> Note the `[AutoPopulate]` properties only appear on the Data Model, not the external Request DTO since we don't want external API consumers to populate them.

For Apps that prefer to never delete rows and instead mark records as deleted so an audit trail is retained, we can implement "Soft Deletes" using an UPDATE to populate the `SoftDelete*` fields behind-the-scenes:

```csharp
[ValidateIsAuthenticated]
[AutoPopulate(nameof(IAudit.SoftDeletedDate), Eval = "utcNow")]
[AutoPopulate(nameof(IAudit.SoftDeletedBy),   Eval = "userAuthName")] //or userAuthId
[AutoPopulate(nameof(IAudit.SoftDeletedInfo), Eval = "`${userSession.DisplayName} (${userSession.City})`")]
public abstract class SoftDeleteAuditBase<Table,TResponse> 
    : IUpdateDb<Table>, IReturn<TResponse> {}

[AutoFilter(QueryTerm.Ensure, nameof(IAuditTenant.TenantId),  Eval = "Request.Items.TenantId")]
public abstract class SoftDeleteAuditTenantBase<Table,TResponse> 
    : SoftDeleteAuditBase<Table,TResponse> {}

public class SoftDeleteAuditTenant 
    : SoftDeleteAuditTenantBase<RockstarAuditTenant, RockstarWithIdResponse>
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
}
```

To implement a "Real" permanently destructive DELETE you would instead implement `IDeleteDb<T>`:

```csharp
[ValidateIsAuthenticated]
[AutoFilter(QueryTerm.Ensure, nameof(IAuditTenant.TenantId),  Eval = "Request.Items.TenantId")]
public class RealDeleteAuditTenant 
    : IDeleteDb<RockstarAuditTenant>, IReturn<RockstarWithIdResponse>
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public int? Age { get; set; }
}
```

### Multi RDBMS Services

As they're just regular ServiceStack Services everything you’re used to that works with normal services also works with new Auto Crud Services, to
recap you can annotate the **DB Model** with the `[NamedConnection]` attribute to specify which 
[registered named connection](/multitenancy#changedb-apphost-registration) AutoQuery should use:

```csharp
[NamedConnection("Reporting")]
public class NamedRockstar : Rockstar { } //DB Model
```

Where all AutoQuery Services for that data model will query the **Reporting** database instead:

```csharp
public class CreateNamedRockstar : RockstarBase, 
    ICreateDb<NamedRockstar>, IReturn<RockstarWithIdAndResultResponse>
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
}

public class UpdateNamedRockstar : RockstarBase, 
    IUpdateDb<NamedRockstar>, IReturn<RockstarWithIdAndResultResponse>
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
}
```

Alternatively the `[ConnectionInfo]` can be [used on Service implementations](/multitenancy#connectioninfo-attribute), but as AutoQuery doesn't 
have them you'd need to provide custom implementations that can delegate to their respective Auto Crud API, e.g:

```csharp
[ConnectionInfo(NamedConnection = MyDatabases.Reporting)]
public class MyReportingServices(IAutoQueryDb autoQuery) : Service
{
    public Task<object> Any(CreateConnectionInfoRockstar request) => 
        autoQuery.CreateAsync(request, Request);

    public Task<object> Any(UpdateConnectionInfoRockstar request) => 
        autoQuery.UpdateAsync(request, Request);
}
```

### AutoFilter

If you're creating Soft Delete & Multi tenant services you'll want to ensure that every query only returns records in their tenant and doesn't return deleted items, which we can implement using an `[AutoFilter]`, e.g:

```csharp
[ValidateIsAuthenticated]
[AutoFilter(QueryTerm.Ensure, nameof(IAudit.SoftDeletedDate), Template = SqlTemplate.IsNull)]
[AutoFilter(QueryTerm.Ensure, nameof(IAuditTenant.TenantId),  Eval = "Request.Items.TenantId")]
public abstract class QueryDbTenant<From, Into> : QueryDb<From, Into> {}
```

The `[AutoFilter]` lets you add pre-configured filters to the query, `QueryTerm.Ensure` utilizes OrmLite's new `Ensure()` APIs which forces always applying this filter, even if the query contains other `OR` conditions.

This base class will then let you create concrete queries that doesn't return soft deleted rows and only returns rows from the same tenant as the authenticated user, e.g:

```csharp
public class QueryRockstarAudit : QueryDbTenant<RockstarAuditTenant, Rockstar>
{
    public int? Id { get; set; }
}
```

To coincide with AutoCRUD there's also support for [declarative validation](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/tests/ServiceStack.WebHost.Endpoints.Tests/AutoQueryCrudTests.Validate.cs) which thanks to [#Script](https://sharpscript.net/) lets you define your Fluent Validation Rules by annotating your Request DTO properties. As it's essentially a different way to define Fluent Validation Rules, it still [needs Validation enabled](/validation#validation-feature) to run:

```csharp
Plugins.Add(new ValidationFeature());
```

### AutoMap and AutoDefault

The `[AutoDefault]` attribute allows you to specify default values that the Data Model should be populated with using the same `#Script` expression support 
available in `[AutoPopulate]` to populate constant values, cached constant expressions or results of full evaluated expressions.

The `[AutoMap]` attributes enables the flexibility of being able to maintain different external property names from their internal data models, but still
be able to declaratively map them.

Here's an example `ICreateDb<T>` AutoCrud Service that makes use of both these attributes to achieve its desired behavior:


```csharp
public class CreateRockstarAutoMapDefault : ICreateDb<Rockstar>, IReturn<RockstarWithIdResponse>
{
    [AutoMap(nameof(Rockstar.FirstName))]
    public string MapFirstName { get; set; }

    [AutoMap(nameof(Rockstar.LastName))]
    public string MapLastName { get; set; }
    
    [AutoMap(nameof(Rockstar.Age))]
    [AutoDefault(Value = 21)]
    public int? MapAge { get; set; }
    
    [AutoMap(nameof(Rockstar.DateOfBirth))]
    [AutoDefault(Expression = "date(2001,1,1)")]
    public DateTime MapDateOfBirth { get; set; }

    [AutoMap(nameof(Rockstar.DateDied))]
    [AutoDefault(Eval = "utcNow")]
    public DateTime? MapDateDied { get; set; }
    
    [AutoMap(nameof(Rockstar.LivingStatus))]
    [AutoDefault(Value = LivingStatus.Dead)]
    public LivingStatus? MapLivingStatus { get; set; }
}
```

### Custom Complex Mapping

Another opportunity to apply more complex custom mapping logic before resorting to creating an actual Service implementation is to make use of
ServiceStack's built-in [Auto Mapping Populator API](/auto-mapping#intercept-automapping-conversions) to intercept an AutoMapping conversion
between 2 types and apply custom logic after `ConvertTo<T>` or `PopulateWith<T>` APIs, e.g:

```csharp
AutoMapping.RegisterPopulator((Dictionary<string,object> target, CreateRockstar source) => 
{
    if (!IsAlive(source))
    {
        target[nameof(source.LivingStatus)] = LivingStatus.Dead;
    }
});
```
 
### Auto Guid's

In addition to supporting `[AutoIncrement]` to insert records with Auto Incrementing Ids, you can use `[AutoId]` to insert entities with
[RDBMS generated UUIDs](/ormlite/reference-support#auto-populated-guid-ids) where they're supported otherwise
OrmLite populates them with `Guid.NewGuid()`.

> Note: usage of inheritance isn't required & has the same behavior as using explicit properties

```csharp
public abstract class RockstarBase
{
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }
    public int? Age { get; set; }
    public DateTime DateOfBirth { get; set; }
}

public class Rockstar : RockstarBase
{
    [AutoId]
    public Guid Id { get; set; }
}

public class CreateRockstarWithAutoGuid : RockstarBase, ICreateDb<Rockstar>, IReturn<RockstarWithIdResponse>
{
}
```

Or if you prefer for Id's to always be populated with `Guid.NewGuid()`, remove `[AutoId]` and populate it with `[AutoPopulate]` instead:

```csharp
[AutoPopulate(nameof(Rockstar.Id),  Eval = "nguid")]
public class CreateRockstarWithAutoGuid : RockstarBase, ICreateDb<Rockstar>, IReturn<RockstarWithIdResponse>
{
}
```

### Optimistic Concurrency

We can declaratively add support for [OrmLite's Optimistic Concurrency](/ormlite/optimistic-concurrency) by
including `ulong RowVersion` property on Auto Crud Request/Response DTOs and Data Models, e.g:

```csharp
// Data Model
public class RockstarVersion : RockstarBase
{
    [AutoIncrement]
    public int Id { get; set; }

    public ulong RowVersion { get; set; }
}

public class CreateRockstarVersion : RockstarBase, ICreateDb<RockstarVersion>,
    IReturn<RockstarWithIdAndRowVersionResponse> { }

public class UpdateRockstarVersion : RockstarBase, IPatchDb<RockstarVersion>,
    IReturn<RockstarWithIdAndRowVersionResponse>
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public ulong RowVersion { get; set; }
}

// Response DTO
public class RockstarWithIdAndRowVersionResponse
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public uint RowVersion { get; set; }
    public ResponseStatus ResponseStatus { get; set; }
}
```

AutoQuery will populate the `RowVersion` in Response DTOs which will need to be provided whenever making changes to that entity where it will fail to update the entity if no `RowVersion` was provided or has since been modified:

```csharp
var createResponse = client.Post(new CreateRockstarVersion {
    FirstName = "Original",
    LastName = "Version",
    Age = 20,
    DateOfBirth = new DateTime(2001,7,1),
    LivingStatus = LivingStatus.Dead,
});

// throws OptimisticConcurrencyException: No RowVersion provided
client.Patch(new UpdateRockstarVersion {
    Id = createResponse.Id, 
    LastName = "UpdatedVersion",
});

// succeeds if "Original Version" wasn't modified otherwise throws OptimisticConcurrencyException 
var response = client.Patch(new UpdateRockstarVersion {
    Id = createResponse.Id, 
    LastName = "UpdatedVersion",
    RowVersion = createResponse.RowVersion,
});
```

### MQ Auto Crud Requests

As Auto Crud Services are just ServiceStack Services they can partake in its ecosystem of features like being able to 
[invoke Services via MQ](/messaging), although there's some extra consideration needed to account for the differences between HTTP and MQ Requests.
First whatever filters you've added to populate the `IRequest.Items` like tenant Id you'll also need to register in `GlobalMessageRequestFilters`
so they're executed for MQ Requests as well:

```csharp
GlobalRequestFilters.Add(SetTenant);        // HTTP Requests
GlobalMessageRequestFilters.Add(SetTenant); // MQ Requests
```

Secondly Auth Information is typically sent in the HTTP Request Headers, but they need to be included in the Request DTO to send Authenticated 
MQ Requests, which can either implement `IHasSessionId` for normal [Session Auth Providers](/auth/authentication-and-authorization#session-authentication-overview), e.g:

```csharp
public class CreateRockstarAuditTenant 
  : CreateAuditTenantBase<RockstarAuditTenant, RockstarWithIdAndResultResponse>, IHasSessionId
{
    public string SessionId { get; set; } //Authenticate MQ Requests
    //...
}
```

Alternatively they can implement `IHasBearerToken` for [stateless Bearer Token](/auth/authentication-and-authorization#authentication-per-request-auth-providers)
Auth providers like JWT or API Keys.

If you're publishing an MQ Request inside a HTTP Service you can use the `PopulateRequestDtoIfAuthenticated` extension method which populates the Request 
DTO from the Authenticated HTTP Request, e.g:

```csharp
public class AutoCrudMqServices : Service
{        
    public void Any(CreateRockstarAuditTenantMq request)
    {
        var mqRequest = request.ConvertTo<CreateRockstarAuditTenant>();
        Request.PopulateRequestDtoIfAuthenticated(mqRequest);
        PublishMessage(mqRequest);
    }
}
```

In this case if using [Background MQ](/background-mq), it will execute the `CreateRockstarAuditTenant` request in a background thread, populating the MQ Request Context with the session identified by the `IRequest.GetSessionId()`.

#### Publishing Requests to OneWay Endpoint

You can also send MQ requests directly by [publishing to the OneWay HTTP endpoint](/messaging#oneway-http-requests-are-published-to-mq-then-executed), which if your AppHost is registered with an MQ Server, it will publish the message to the MQ and auto populate Request DTOs that implements `IHasSessionId` or `IHasBearerToken`, either if implicitly sent from an Authenticated client:

```csharp
var authResponse = authClient.Post(new Authenticate {
    provider = "credentials",
    UserName = "admin@email.com",
    Password = "p@55wOrd",
    RememberMe = true,
});

authClient.SendOneWay(new CreateRockstarAuditTenant {
    FirstName = nameof(CreateRockstarAuditTenant),
    LastName = "SessionId",
    Age = 20,
    DateOfBirth = new DateTime(2002,2,2),
});
```

Or from an anonymous client with the explicit `BearerToken` or `SessionId` properties populated, e.g:

```csharp
client.SendOneWay(new CreateRockstarAuditMqToken {
    BearerToken = JwtUserToken,
    FirstName = nameof(CreateRockstarAuditMqToken),
    LastName = "JWT",
    Age = 20,
    DateOfBirth = new DateTime(2002,2,2),
});
```

To save populating the `BearerToken` in each request, you can set it once on the Service Client which will automatically populate it on Request DTOs:

```csharp
client.BearerToken = jwtUserToken;
```

## Declarative Validation

To facilitate greater declarative functionality around ServiceStack Services, this release also introduces support for declarative validation
where all existing [Fluent Validation Property Validators](/validation#validation-feature) can be annotated on Request DTOs using typed validation 
attributes which are decoupled from their Validator implementation so they're suitable to be annotated on impl-free Service Model DTOs and exported in 
[Add ServiceStack Reference](/add-servicestack-reference) Types.

> As they're decoupled they can eventually be used to implement instant validation feedback on clients without server round trips

The validators are incorporated into ServiceStack's existing Fluent Validation model so it [works with existing UI form binding](/world-validation). 

### Property Validators

The new Property Validator attributes provide an alternative way to apply Request DTO validation rules, the best way to demonstrate them 
is showing the same example below implemented using Fluent Validation APIs:

```csharp
public class ExampleValidatorsValidator : AbstractValidator<ExampleValidators>
{
    public ExampleValidatorsValidator()
    {
        RuleFor(x => x.CreditCard).CreditCard();
        RuleFor(x => x.Email).EmailAddress();
        RuleFor(x => x.Empty).Empty();
        RuleFor(x => x.Equal).Equal("Equal");
        RuleFor(x => x.ExclusiveBetween).ExclusiveBetween(10, 20);
        RuleFor(x => x.GreaterThanOrEqual).GreaterThanOrEqualTo(10);
        RuleFor(x => x.GreaterThan).GreaterThan(10);
        RuleFor(x => x.InclusiveBetween).InclusiveBetween(10, 20);
        RuleFor(x => x.Length).Length(10);
        RuleFor(x => x.LessThanOrEqual).LessThanOrEqualTo(10);
        RuleFor(x => x.LessThan).LessThan(10);
        RuleFor(x => x.NotEmpty).NotEmpty();
        RuleFor(x => x.NotEqual).NotEqual("NotEqual");
        RuleFor(x => x.Null).Null();
        RuleFor(x => x.ScalePrecision).ScalePrecision(1,1);
        RuleFor(x => x.RegularExpression).Matches(@"^[a-z]*$");
    }
}
```

For each property validator above you can use a Typed Property Validation Attribute in the format `[Validate*]`:

```csharp
public class ExampleValidators : ICreateDb<ExampleValidator>, IReturn<EmptyResponse>
{
    [ValidateCreditCard]
    public string CreditCard { get; set; }
    [ValidateEmail]
    public string Email { get; set; }
    [ValidateEmpty]
    public string Empty { get; set; }
    [ValidateEqual("Equal")]
    public string Equal { get; set; }
    [ValidateLessThan(10)]
    public int LessThan { get; set; }
    [ValidateLessThanOrEqual(10)]
    public int LessThanOrEqual { get; set; }
    [ValidateGreaterThan(10)]
    public int GreaterThan { get; set; }
    [ValidateGreaterThanOrEqual(10)]
    public int GreaterThanOrEqual { get; set; }
    [ValidateExclusiveBetween(10, 20)]
    public int ExclusiveBetween { get; set; }
    [ValidateInclusiveBetween(10, 20)]
    public int InclusiveBetween { get; set; }
    [ValidateExactLength(10)]
    public string Length { get; set; }
    [ValidateNotEmpty]
    public string NotEmpty { get; set; }
    [ValidateNotEqual("NotEqual")]
    public string NotEqual { get; set; }
    [ValidateNull]
    public string Null { get; set; }
    [ValidateScalePrecision(1,1)]
    public decimal ScalePrecision { get; set; }
    [ValidateRegularExpression("^[a-z]*$")]
    public string RegularExpression { get; set; }
}
```

All Typed Validator Attributes above are just providing a typed subclass wrapper around the generic `[Validate]`, so the implementation of
the `[ValidateLessThan]` is just:

```csharp
public class ValidateLessThanAttribute : ValidateAttribute
{
    public ValidateLessThanAttribute(int value) : base($"LessThan({value})") { }
}
```

So the same Typed Validator above is equivalent to using the untyped generic `[Validate]` attribute below:

```csharp
public class ExampleValidators : ICreateDb<ExampleValidator>, IReturn<EmptyResponse>
{
    [Validate("CreditCard")]
    public string CreditCard { get; set; }
    [Validate("Email")]
    public string Email { get; set; }
    [Validate("Empty")]
    public string Empty { get; set; }
    [Validate("Equal('Equal')")]
    public string Equal { get; set; }
    [Validate("ExclusiveBetween(10, 20)")]
    public int ExclusiveBetween { get; set; }
    [Validate("GreaterThanOrEqual(10)")]
    public int GreaterThanOrEqual { get; set; }
    [Validate("GreaterThan(10)")]
    public int GreaterThan { get; set; }
    [Validate("InclusiveBetween(10, 20)")]
    public int InclusiveBetween { get; set; }
    [Validate("ExactLength(10)")]
    public string Length { get; set; }
    [Validate("LessThanOrEqual(10)")]
    public int LessThanOrEqual { get; set; }
    [Validate("LessThan(10)")]
    public int LessThan { get; set; }
    [Validate("NotEmpty")]
    public string NotEmpty { get; set; }
    [Validate("NotEqual('NotEqual')")]
    public string NotEqual { get; set; }
    [Validate("Null")]
    public string Null { get; set; }
    [Validate("RegularExpression('^[a-z]*$')")]
    public string RegularExpression { get; set; }
    [Validate("ScalePrecision(1,1)")]
    public decimal ScalePrecision { get; set; }
}
```

Where the **Validator Expression** is a `#Script` Expression that returns a Fluent Validation `IPropertyValidator` defined
in the built-in [ValidateScripts.cs](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/src/ServiceStack/ValidateScripts.cs):

```csharp
public class ValidateScripts : ScriptMethods
{
    public IPropertyValidator Null() => new NullValidator();
    public IPropertyValidator Empty() => new EmptyValidator(null);
    public IPropertyValidator Empty(object defaultValue) => new EmptyValidator(defaultValue);
    public IPropertyValidator Equal(object value) => new EqualValidator(value);
    public IPropertyValidator NotNull() => new NotNullValidator();
    public IPropertyValidator NotEmpty() => new NotEmptyValidator(null);
    public IPropertyValidator NotEmpty(object defaultValue) => new NotEmptyValidator(defaultValue);
    public IPropertyValidator NotEqual(object value) => new NotEqualValidator(value);
    public IPropertyValidator CreditCard() => new CreditCardValidator();
    public IPropertyValidator Email() => new AspNetCoreCompatibleEmailValidator();
    public IPropertyValidator Length(int min, int max) => new LengthValidator(min, max);
    public IPropertyValidator ExactLength(int length) => new ExactLengthValidator(length);
    public IPropertyValidator MaximumLength(int max) => new MaximumLengthValidator(max);
    public IPropertyValidator MinimumLength(int min) => new MinimumLengthValidator(min);
    public IPropertyValidator InclusiveBetween(IComparable from, IComparable to) =>
        new InclusiveBetweenValidator(from, to);
    public IPropertyValidator ExclusiveBetween(IComparable from, IComparable to) =>
        new ExclusiveBetweenValidator(from, to);
    public IPropertyValidator LessThan(int value) => new LessThanValidator(value);
    public IPropertyValidator LessThanOrEqual(int value) => new LessThanOrEqualValidator(value);
    public IPropertyValidator GreaterThan(int value) => new GreaterThanValidator(value);
    public IPropertyValidator GreaterThanOrEqual(int value) => new GreaterThanOrEqualValidator(value);
    public IPropertyValidator ScalePrecision(int scale, int precision) =>
        new ScalePrecisionValidator(scale, precision);
    public IPropertyValidator RegularExpression(string regex) => 
        new RegularExpressionValidator(regex, RegexOptions.Compiled);
}
```

### Validated Validator Expressions

Despite using untyped string Expressions, **Validator** expressions still provide early error detection as on `Startup` each `#Script` 
expression is evaluated and verified that it resolves to a valid `IPropertyValidator` instance otherwise fails with a **Startup Exception**.
If the instance returned is valid it's merged with any other `AbstractValidator<T>` that may also be defined for the same Request DTO Type, 
where it lets you mix n' match declarative attributes together with Fluent Validation rules.

### Defining Multiple Validators

You can specify multiple Property Validators should be applied within a single Validator expression by using `[]` Array notation, 
alternatively you can apply multiple Validate attributes and use C# syntax to combine them in a single line:

```csharp
public class ExampleValidators
{
    [Validate("[NotNull,InclusiveBetween(13,100)]")]
    public int? ValidateAge { get; set; }

    [ValidateNotNull,ValidateInclusiveBetween(13,100)]
    public int? TypedAge { get; set; }
}
```

### Registering Custom Declarative Validators

As `[Validate*]` attributes just execute a Script Method they're easily extensible by [defining and register your own](https://sharpscript.net/docs/methods), e.g:

```csharp
public class MyValidateScripts : ScriptMethods
{
    public IPropertyValidator Custom(int arg) => new MyCustomValidator(arg);
}
```

Which can be registered, either directly on your [Script Pages plugin](https://sharpscript.net/docs/script-pages) if your AppHost uses one:

```csharp
Plugins.Add(new SharpPagesFeature {
    ScriptMethods = { new CustomScriptMethods() }
});
```

Otherwise you can use the AppHost's new `ScriptContext` which adds it to the AppHost's empty `ScriptContext`:

```csharp
ScriptContext.ScriptMethods.Add(new CustomScriptMethods());
```

> `ScriptContext` also returns `SharpPagesFeature` if registered, in which case both registration examples are equivalent

After which you'll immediately be able to use it with the `[Validate]` attribute:

```csharp
[Validate("Custom(1)")]
public int Test { get; set; }
```

Likewise you can create a typed Validate attribute around it which you can use instead:

```csharp
public class ValidateCustomAttribute : ValidateAttribute
{
    public ValidateCustomAttribute(int arg) : base($"Custom({arg})") { }
}
//...

[ValidateCustom(1)]
public int Test { get; set; }
```

### Custom Script Validation

Fluent Validation Validators are a nice model for defining reusable validation rules however they can require a bit of boilerplate
if you only need to define a one-off validation check. In these cases we can provide an even lighter weight solution by being able
to defining our validation condition inline with `#Script` by specifying it in the `Condition` attribute, e.g:

```csharp
public class ExampleValidators : ICreateDb<ExampleValidator>, IReturn<EmptyResponse>
{
    [Validate(Condition = "it.isOdd()")]
    public int IsOddCondition { get; set; }

    [Validate(Condition = "it.isOdd() && it.log10() > 2")]
    public int IsOddAndOverTwoDigitsCondition { get; set; }

    [Validate(Condition = "it.isOdd() || it.log10() > 2")]
    public int IsOddOrOverTwoDigitsCondition { get; set; }
}
```

Script Conditions are valid if they return a **truthy** value and have access to the following arguments within their Expression: 

 - `Request`: IRequest
 - `dto`: Request DTO
 - `field`: Property Name
 - `it`: Property Value

If you're reusing the same Expression a nice solution for maintaining them is in a static class where you can use the `AllConditions`
and `AnyConditions` helper properties to compose individual checks, e.g:

```csharp
public static class ValidationConditions
{
    public const string IsOdd = "it.isOdd()";
    public const string IsOver2Digits = "it.log10() > 2";
}

public class ExampleValidators : ICreateDb<ExampleValidator>, IReturn<EmptyResponse>
{
    [Validate(Condition = ValidationConditions.IsOdd)]
    public int IsOddCondition { get; set; }

    [Validate(AllConditions = new[]{ ValidationConditions.IsOdd, ValidationConditions.IsOver2Digits })]
    public int IsOddAndOverTwoDigitsCondition { get; set; }

    [Validate(AnyConditions = new[]{ ValidationConditions.IsOdd, ValidationConditions.IsOver2Digits })]
    public int IsOddOrOverTwoDigitsCondition { get; set; }
}
```

Despite not using a validator all `#Script` Conditions are executed using a custom Fluent Validation `IPredicateValidator`
(called [ScriptConditionValidator](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/src/ServiceStack/Validators.cs)) so it able to slot right 
in with all other Property Validators.

### Custom Error Codes and Messages

The other aspect of validators that can be overridden declaratively are the **ErrorCode** and Error **Message** returned in ServiceStack's
[structured Error Response](/error-handling), specified using the `ErrorCode` and `Message` Attribute properties:

```csharp
public class ExampleValidators : ICreateDb<ExampleValidator>, IReturn<EmptyResponse>
{
    [ValidateNotNull(ErrorCode = "ZError")]
    public string CustomErrorCode { get; set; }
    
    // Overrides both ErrorCode & Message
    [ValidateInclusiveBetween(1,2, ErrorCode = "ZError", 
        Message = "{PropertyName} has to be between {From} and {To}, you: {PropertyValue}")]
    public int CustomErrorCodeAndMessage { get; set; }

    // Overrides ErrorCode & uses Message from Validators
    [ValidateNotNull(ErrorCode = "RuleMessage")]
    public string ErrorCodeRule { get; set; }

    [Validate(Condition = ValidationConditions.IsOdd)]
    public int IsOddCondition { get; set; }

    [Validate(AllConditions = new[]{ ValidationConditions.IsOdd, ValidationConditions.IsOver2Digits }, 
        ErrorCode = "RuleMessage")]
    public int IsOddAndOverTwoDigitsCondition { get; set; }
}
```

All Error Messages can reference the `{PropertyName}` and `{PropertyValue}` in their messages along with any other MessageFormatter
placeholders defined by the validator, e.g. the [InclusiveBetweenValidator.cs](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/src/ServiceStack/FluentValidation/Validators/InclusiveBetweenValidator.cs) used above also defines the `{From}`, `{To}` and `{Value}` placeholders.

`#Script` Conditions can define their Error codes in the centralized `ConditionErrorCodes` Dictionary in the `ValidationFeature` Plugin
where all `IsOdd` conditions will return the **NotOdd** custom error code.

The Error Messages can also be defined in the centralized `ErrorCodeMessages` Dictionary which defines the Error Messages that all failed
**NotOdd** or **RuleMessage** rules will use, e.g:

```csharp
Plugins.Add(new ValidationFeature {
    ConditionErrorCodes = {
        [ValidationConditions.IsOdd] = "NotOdd",
    },
    ErrorCodeMessages = {
        ["NotOdd"] = "{PropertyName} must be odd",
        ["RuleMessage"] = "ErrorCodeMessages for RuleMessage",
    }
});
```

### Type Validators

In addition to Property Validators there's also new support for **Type Validators** which can be declaratively added to perform top-level 
validation on Request DTOs.

They behave and function the same as Property Validators where you can use either the typed or the generic `[ValidateRequest]` attribute.

ServiceStack includes built-in Type Validator attributes for all [Authorization Filter Attributes](/auth/authentication-and-authorization#the-authenticate-attribute) 
but as they're decoupled from any implementation they can be safely annotated on Request DTOs without requiring any implementation dependencies.

```csharp
[ValidateIsAuthenticated]            // or [ValidateRequest("IsAuthenticated")]
[ValidateIsAdmin]                    // or [ValidateRequest("IsAdmin")]
[ValidateHasRole(role)]              // or [ValidateRequest($"HasRole(`{role}`)")]
[ValidateHasPermission(permission)]  // or [ValidateRequest($"HasPermission(`{permission}`)")
```

Just like Property Validators, the Typed Validator attributes are wrappers around the generic `[ValidateRequest]` attribute, e.g:

```csharp
public class ValidateIsAuthenticatedAttribute : ValidateRequestAttribute
{
    public ValidateIsAuthenticatedAttribute() : base("IsAuthenticated") { }
}
```

Which are also defined in [ValidateScripts.cs](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/src/ServiceStack/ValidateScripts.cs) 
but instead return a `ITypeValidator`:

```csharp
public class ValidateScripts : ScriptMethods
{
    public ITypeValidator IsAuthenticated() => new IsAuthenticatedValidator();
    public ITypeValidator IsAuthenticated(string provider) => new IsAuthenticatedValidator(provider);
    public ITypeValidator HasRole(string role) => new HasRolesValidator(role);
    public ITypeValidator HasRoles(string[] roles) => new HasRolesValidator(roles);
    public ITypeValidator HasPermission(string permission) => new HasPermissionsValidator(permission);
    public ITypeValidator HasPermissions(string[] permission) => new HasPermissionsValidator(permission);
    public ITypeValidator IsAdmin() => new HasRolesValidator(RoleNames.Admin);
}
```

#### Custom Type Attributes

The easiest way to create a an `ITypeValidator` is to inherit from the `TypeValidator` base class, including both the **ErrorCode**
and **Error Message** failed requests should return. 

An example where you might use one is when testing the pre-condition state of an entity which doesn't logically map to a property.
In the example below we're validating to ensure that the entity doesn't have any Foreign Key References:

```csharp
public class NoRockstarAlbumReferences : TypeValidator
{
    public NoRockstarAlbumReferences() 
        : base("HasForeignKeyReferences", "Has RockstarAlbum References") {}

    public override async Task<bool> IsValidAsync(object dto, IRequest request)
    {
        //Example of using compiled accessor delegates to access `Id` property
        //var id = TypeProperties.Get(dto.GetType()).GetPublicGetter("Id")(dto).ConvertTo<int>();

        var id = ((IHasId<int>)dto).Id;
        using var db = HostContext.AppHost.GetDbConnection(request);
        return !await db.ExistsAsync<RockstarAlbum>(x => x.RockstarId == id);
    }
}
```

Then we need to register it as a custom script method to be able to reference it in `[ValidateRequest]`:

```csharp
public class MyValidators : ScriptMethods
{
    public ITypeValidator NoRockstarAlbumReferences() => new NoRockstarAlbumReferences();
}
```

Which we can now declaratively reference by script method name:

```csharp
[ValidateRequest(nameof(NoRockstarAlbumReferences))]
public class ExampleValidators : ICreateDb<Rockstar>, IReturn<RockstarWithIdResponse>, IHasId<int>
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    
    [ValidateNotNull] //doesn't get validated if ValidateRequest is invalid
    public string NotNull { get; set; }
}
```

Type Validators are executed before any property validators, which if failed wont be executed.

### Type Script Conditions

Type Validators can also execute `#Script` expressions where we could implement the above FK check inline using
a sync [Database Script](https://sharpscript.net/docs/db-scripts):

```csharp
[ValidateRequest(Condition = "!dbExistsSync('SELECT * FROM RockstarAlbum WHERE RockstarId = @Id', { it.Id })", 
    ErrorCode = "HasForeignKeyReferences")]
public class ExampleValidators : ICreateDb<Rockstar>, IReturn<RockstarWithIdResponse>
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    
    [ValidateNotNull] //doesn't get validated if ValidateRequest is invalid
    public string NotNull { get; set; }
}
```

> Note the condition needs to return a **truthy** value so you'd need to use the sync DB Script APIs to return
a boolean instead of an async Task.

Type Validators can also specify custom Error Codes and Error Messages, they can also specify a custom HTTP 
Error StatusCode that failed requests should return.

```csharp
[ValidateRequest(Condition = "it.Test.isOdd() && it.Test.log10() > 2",
    ErrorCode = "NotOddAndOver2Decimals", Message = "Pre-condition Failed", StatusCode = 401)]
public class ExampleValidators : ICreateDb<ExampleValidator>, IReturn<EmptyResponse> { }
```

### DB Validation Rules

Both Property and Type Validators can also be sourced from a **dynamic source** with both **Memory** and **RDBMS** implementations included 
along with a Management HTTP API to be able to manage them remotely. Dynamic Validation Rules are cacheable locally giving them the same 
performance profile as declarative attributes in code whose caches are only invalidated once they've been updated, upon which they'll come into
immediate effect.

Here's a [Modular Startup](/modular-startup) class you can drop into a ServiceStack Project to enable maintaining declarative Validation 
Rules in your configured RDBMS:

```csharp
public class ConfigureValidation : IConfigureServices, IConfigureAppHost
{
    public void Configure(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        // Add support for dynamically generated db rules
        services.AddSingleton<IValidationSource>(c => 
            new OrmLiteValidationSource(c.Resolve<IDbConnectionFactory>()));
    }

    public void Configure(IAppHost appHost)
    {
        appHost.Plugins.Add(new ValidationFeature());
        appHost.Resolve<IValidationSource>().InitSchema();
    }
}
```

DB Validation rules can be added programmatically, this example below adds 1x Type Validator and 2x Property Validators to the 
`DynamicRules` Request DTO:

```csharp
var validationSource = container.Resolve<IValidationSource>();
validationSource.SaveValidationRulesAsync(new List<ValidationRule> {
    new ValidationRule { Type  = nameof(DynamicRules), Validator = "IsAuthenticated" },
    new ValidationRule { Type  = nameof(DynamicRules), Validator = "NotNull", 
                         Field = nameof(DynamicRules.LastName) },
    new ValidationRule { Type  = nameof(DynamicRules), Validator = "InclusiveBetween(13,100)", 
                         Field = nameof(DynamicRules.Age) },
});
```

**Admin** Users can also manage these rules remotely using the `ModifyValidationRules` Service defined below:

```csharp
public class ModifyValidationRules : IReturnVoid
{
    public string AuthSecret { get; set; }

    public List<ValidationRule> SaveRules { get; set; }

    public int[] DeleteRuleIds { get; set; }

    public int[] SuspendRuleIds { get; set; }

    public int[] UnsuspendRuleIds { get; set; }
    
    public bool? ClearCache { get; set; }
}
```

Later we'll showcase the UX-friendly UI you can also use to manage them when we introduce ServiceStack Studio.

## Executable Audit Log

In addition to being able to declaratively develop AutoQuery and CRUD APIs without needing to implement them, you're also able
to enable a **recorded history of Executable Audit information** over all AutoCrud operations in an executable audit log that in addition
to maintaining an automated recorded history of every change to an entity also exhibits "EventSourcing-like capabilities" in being able
to recreate the entities state using the latest Services implementation by replaying all AutoCrud operations in order, which can be 
applied on a granular entity, table level, or in the unlikely case that all System DB writes are performed through AutoQuery CRUD Services, 
it's capable of re-creating the entire DB state from just its Audit history, although is dependent on whether all changes made to
AutoCrud Services are backwards compatible.

Being able to rebuild your Systems DB by replaying audit history events is a nice property that can serve as an integrity check to
verify that all changes leading up to the current DB state has been recorded. As data is the most important part of most systems it
can be beneficial to maintain a change history of when items were created, modified and deleted (and by whom) as we're used to 
when using a VCS for our source code. Typically this means also employing "non destructive" approaches to system design like "Soft Deletes" 
which you can declaratively implement with Auto CRUD.

### Executable Crud Audit Events

This feature tries to obtain some of the nice features of Event Sourcing but without the additional complexity by allowing you to 
capture all CRUD operations in an executable log whilst still retaining your RDBMS as your master authority. 
This feature doesn’t require any additional dev overhead as your AutoCrud Request DTOs are the recorded events.

To enable this feature you just need to register an [ICrudEvents](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/src/ServiceStack.Server/CrudEvents.cs) 
provider which will let you persist your events in any data store, but typically you’d use OrmLiteCrudEvents to persist it in 
the same RDBMS that the AutoCrud requests are already writing to, e.g:

```csharp
container.AddSingleton<ICrudEvents>(c =>
    new OrmLiteCrudEvents(c.Resolve<IDbConnectionFactory>()) {
        // NamedConnections = { SystemDatabases.Reporting }
    });
container.Resolve<ICrudEvents>().InitSchema();
```

If you’re using Multitenancy features or multiple RDBMS’s in your AutoCrud DTOs you can add them to NamedConnections where 
it will create an CrudEvent table in each of the RDBMS’s used.

and that’s all that’s required, now every AutoCrud operation will persist the Request DTO and associative metadata in the 
Event entry below within a DB transaction:

```csharp
public class CrudEvent : IMeta
{
    [AutoIncrement]
    public long Id { get; set; }    
    // AutoCrudOperation, e.g. Create, Update, Patch, Delete, Save
    public string EventType { get; set; }    
    public string Model { get; set; }         // DB Model Name    
    public string ModelId { get; set; }       // Primary Key of DB Model
    public DateTime EventDate { get; set; }   // UTC
    public long? RowsUpdated { get; set; }    // How many rows were affected
    public string RequestType { get; set; }   // Request DTO Type    
    public string RequestBody { get; set; }   // Serialized Request Body    
    public string UserAuthId { get; set; }    // UserAuthId if Authenticated    
    public string UserAuthName { get; set; }  // UserName or unique User Identity
    public string RemoteIp { get; set; }      // Remote IP of the Request
    public string Urn { get; set; }           // URN format: urn:{requestType}:{ModelId}

    // Custom Reference Data with or with non-integer Primary Key
    public int? RefId { get; set; }
    public string RefIdStr { get; set; }
    public Dictionary<string, string> Meta { get; set; }
}
```

### Full Executable Audit History

With what's captured this will serve as an Audit History of state changes for any row by querying the `Model` & `ModelId` columns, e.g:

```csharp
var dbEvents = (OrmLiteCrudEvents)container.Resolve<ICrudEvents>();
var rowAuditEvents = dbEvents.GetEvents(Db, nameof(Rockstar), id);
```

The contents of the Request DTO stored as JSON in `RequestBody`. You can quickly display the contents of any JSON in human-friendly 
HTML with the [htmlDump](https://sharpscript.net/docs/html-scripts#htmldump) script if you're using `#Script`, `@Html.HtmlDump(obj)` 
if you're using Razor or just the static `ViewUtils.HtmlDump(obj)` method to get a raw pretty-formatted HTML String.

### Replay AutoCrud Requests

If all your database was created with AutoCrud Services you could delete its rows and re-create it by just re-playing all your 
AutoCrud DTOs in the order they were executed, which can be done with:

```csharp
var eventsPlayer = new CrudEventsExecutor(appHost);
foreach (var crudEvent in dbEvents.GetEvents(db))
{
    await eventsPlayer.ExecuteAsync(crudEvent);
}
```

The `CrudEventsExecutor` uses your AppHost's `ServiceController` to execute the message, e,g. same execution pipeline MQ Requests use, 
so it will execute your AppHost's `GlobalMessageRequestFilters/Async` if you have any custom logic in Request Filters 
(e.g. Multi TenantId example above). It also executes authenticated AutoCrud requests as the original AutoCrud Request Authenticated User, 
which just like [JWT Refresh Tokens](/auth/jwt-authprovider#requires-user-auth-repository-or-iusersessionsource)
will require either using an AuthRepository or if you're using a Custom Auth Provider you can implement an `IUserSessionSource` to 
load User Sessions from a custom data store.

When replaying the Audit Events it will use the original primary key, even if you're using `[AutoIncrement]` Primary Keys, 
this will let you re-create the state of a single entry, e.g:

```csharp
db.DeleteById<Rockstar>(id);
var rowAuditEvents = dbEvents.GetEvents(Db, nameof(Rockstar), id);
foreach (var crudEvent in rowAuditEvents)
{
    await eventsPlayer.ExecuteAsync(crudEvent);
}
```

If for instance you wanted it to execute through your latest logic with any enhancements or bug fixes, etc.


## AutoGen AutoQuery & Crud Services

Long time users of ServiceStack will know it's a staunch proponent of **code-first development** where your C# Types retains the 
master authority of your App's logic, although there are a number of times where you have to work with existing databases which 
would require significant effort to create the initial code-first Data Models. Historically we've pointed people to use 
[OrmLite's T4 Template Support](/ormlite/autogen-t4#t4-template-support) which provides a decent initial stab, 
however it's limited in its capability and offers a sub par development experience.

### Code Generation of AutoQuery & Crud Services

Now with AutoCrud we can add a lot more value in this area as AutoCrud's declarative nature allows us to easily generate AutoQuery & Crud Services 
by just emitting declarative Request DTOs.

You can then add the generated DTOs to your ServiceModel's to quickly enable AutoQuery Services for your existing databases.

To enable this feature you you just need to initialize `GenerateCrudServices` in your `AutoQueryFeature` plugin, e.g:

```csharp
Plugins.Add(new AutoQueryFeature {
    MaxLimit = 1000,
    GenerateCrudServices = new GenerateCrudServices {}
});
```

If you don't have an existing database, you can quickly test this out with a Northwind SQLite database available from 
[github.com/NetCoreApps/NorthwindAuto](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/NorthwindAuto):

    $ x download NetCoreApps/NorthwindAuto

As you'll need to use 2 terminal windows, I'd recommend opening the project with **VS Code** which has great multi-terminal support:

    $ code NorthwindAuto

The important parts of this project is the registering the OrmLite DB Connection, the above configuration and the local **northwind.sqlite** database, i.e:

```csharp
container.AddSingleton<IDbConnectionFactory>(c =>
    new OrmLiteConnectionFactory(MapProjectPath("~/northwind.sqlite"), SqliteDialect.Provider));

Plugins.Add(new AutoQueryFeature {
    MaxLimit = 1000,
    GenerateCrudServices = new GenerateCrudServices {}
});
```

#### Generating AutoQuery Types & Services

The development experience is essentially the same as [Add ServiceStack Reference](/add-servicestack-reference) 
where you'll need to run the .NET Core App in 1 terminal:

    $ dotnet run

Then use the `x` dotnet tool to download all the AutoQuery & Crud Services for all tables in the configured DB connection:

    $ x csharp https://localhost:5001 -path /crud/all/csharp

#### Updating Generated Services

If your RDBMS schema changes you'd just need to restart your .NET Core App, then you can update all existing `dtos.cs` with:

    $ x csharp

i.e. the same experience as updating normal DTOs.

You can do the same for all other ServiceStack's supported languages as shown in autodto at the start of this release.

## AutoRegister AutoGen AutoQuery Services!

To recap we've now got an integrated scaffolding solution where we can quickly generate code-first AutoQuery Services and integrate them 
into our App to quickly build an AutoQuery Service layer around our existing database.

But we can raise the productivity level even higher by instead of manually importing the code-generated Services into our project we 
just tell ServiceStack to do it for us! 

This is what the magical `AutoRegister` flag does for us:

```csharp
Plugins.Add(new AutoQueryFeature {
    GenerateCrudServices = new GenerateCrudServices {
        AutoRegister = true,
        //....
    }
});
```

### Instantly Servicify Northwind DB with gRPC

To show the exciting potential of this feature we'll demonstrate one valuable use-case of creating a [grpc](/grpc/)
project, mixing in AutoQuery configuration to instantly Servicifying the Northwind DB, browsing the generated Services from ServiceStack's
[Metadata Page](/metadata-page), explore the gRPC RPC Services `.proto` then create a new Dart App to consume the gRPC Services:

> YouTube: [youtu.be/5NNCaWMviXU](https://youtu.be/5NNCaWMviXU)

[![](/img/pages/release-notes/v5.9/autogen-grpc.png)](https://youtu.be/5NNCaWMviXU)


#### Step-by-step Guide

See the annotated guide below to follow along:

Create a new [grpc](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/grpc) .NET Core project and open it in VS Code:

    $ x new grpc NorthwindApi
    $ code NorthwindApi

Inside VS Code open a Terminal Window and [mix in](/mix-tool) the required configuration:

    $ cd NorthwindApi
    $ x mix autocrudgen sqlite northwind.sqlite

Which will mix in the [autocrudgen](https://gist.github.com/gistlyn/464a80c15cb3af4f41db7810082dc00c) gist to enable AutoQuery and 
tell it to Auto Generate AutoQuery and CRUD Services for all tables in the registered RDBMS:

```csharp
public class ConfigureAutoQuery : IConfigureAppHost
{
    public void Configure(IAppHost appHost)
    {
        appHost.Plugins.Add(new AutoQueryFeature {
            MaxLimit = 1000,
            GenerateCrudServices = new GenerateCrudServices {
                AutoRegister = true
            }
        });
    }
}
```

The [sqlite](https://gist.github.com/gistlyn/768d7b330b8c977f43310b954ceea668) gist registers an 
[OrmLite.Sqlite](/ormlite/) RDBMS connection with our App which we want to configure
to connect to a **northwind.sqlite** database:

```csharp
public void Configure(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddSingleton<IDbConnectionFactory>(new OrmLiteConnectionFactory(
        Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection") 
            ?? "northwind.sqlite",
        SqliteDialect.Provider));
}
```

Then we apply the [northwind.sqlite](https://gist.github.com/gistlyn/97d0bcd3ebd582e06c85f8400683e037) gist to add the 
**northwind.sqlite** database to our new project.

Now that our App's configured we can run it with:

    $ dotnet run

Where it will start the ServiceStack gRPC App on 3 ports configured in **appsettings.json**:

 - `5001` - Enables access from existing HTTP/1.1 clients and proxies
 - `5002` - Enables a secure gRPC Channel
 - `5003` - Enables an insecure gRPC Channel

```json
{
  "Kestrel": {
    "Endpoints": {
      "Https": {
        "Url": "https://*:5001",
        "Protocols": "Http1"
      },
      "GrpcSecure": {
        "Url": "https://*:5051",
        "Protocols": "Http2"
      },
      "GrpcInsecure" : {
        "Url": "http://*:5054",
        "Protocols": "Http2"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Once running you can view your Apps metadata page at `https://localhost:5001` to inspect all the Services that were generated.

#### Create Dart gRPC Console App

It's also now accessible via [ServiceStack's gRPC endpoint](/grpc/) which opens your generated Services up to [Google's high-performance gRPC ecosystem](https://grpc.io)
which enables typed, high-performance integrations into exciting platforms like [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) which uses the [Dart](https://dart.dev) programming language
to create Reactive, high-performance native Android and iOS Apps. 

We can test Dart's gRPC integration and development workflow in a new Dart Console App we can create with:

    $ mkdir dart-grpc && cd dart-grpc
    $ pub global activate stagehand
    $ stagehand console-full

We'll need to update **pubspec.yaml** with the required gRPC dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  fixnum: ^0.10.11
  async: ^2.2.0
  protobuf: ^1.0.1
  grpc: ^2.1.3    
```

When you save **pubspec.yaml** Dart's VS Code extension will automatically fetch any new dependencies which can also be manually run with:

    $ pub get

We can then use the [protoc support in the dotnet tools](/grpc#public-grpc-protoc-service-and-ui) to download our `.proto` Services descriptor 
and generate Dart's gRPC classes with a single command:

    $ x proto-dart https://localhost:5001 -out lib

We're now all set to consume our gRPC Services using the protoc generated gRPC proxy in our `main()` function in **main.dart**:

```dart
import 'dart:io';
import 'package:grpc/grpc.dart';
import 'package:dart_grpc/services.pb.dart';
import 'package:dart_grpc/services.pbgrpc.dart';

void main(List<String> arguments) async {
    var client = GrpcServicesClient(ClientChannel('localhost', port:5054,
      options:ChannelOptions(credentials: ChannelCredentials.insecure())));

    var response = await client.getQueryCategory(QueryCategory());
    print(response.results);
    exit(0);
}
```

Which can be run with:

    $ dart bin\main.dart

### Calling gRPC SSL Services

The [Dart gRPC Docs](/grpc/dart#dart-protoc-grpc-ssl-example) shows how we can connect to it via our gRPC SSL endpoint by running the
openssl scripts in [grpc/scripts](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/grpc/tree/master/scripts) to generate our **dev.crt** and **prod.crt**
SSL Certificates that you can configure in your in your **GrpcSecure** endpoint with:

```json
{
  "Kestrel": {
    "Endpoints": {
      "GrpcSecure": {
        "Url": "https://*:5051",
        "Protocols": "Http2",
        "Certificate": {
          "Path": "dev.pfx",
          "Password": "grpc"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Where you'll then be able to access the secure gRPC SSL endpoints using the generated **dev.crt** certificate in your Dart App:

```dart
import 'dart:io';
import 'package:grpc/grpc.dart';
import 'package:dart_grpc/services.pb.dart';
import 'package:dart_grpc/services.pbgrpc.dart';

GrpcServicesClient createClient({CallOptions options}) {
  return GrpcServicesClient(ClientChannel('localhost', port:5051,
    options:ChannelOptions(credentials: ChannelCredentials.secure(
        certificates: File('dev.crt').readAsBytesSync(),
        authority: 'localhost'))), options:options);
}

void main(List<String> args) async {

    var client = createClient();
    var response = await client.getQueryCategory(QueryCategory());
    print(response.results);

    exit(0);
}
```

### AutoGen's AutoRegister Implementation

Whilst the `AutoRegister = true` flag on its face may seem magical, it's simply an instruction that tells ServiceStack to register the 
**new** AutoQuery Services it already knows about and register them as if they were normal code-first Services that we had written ourselves.

More accurately, behind-the-scenes it uses the Metadata Type structure it constructed in generating the Services & Types, 
i.e. the same Types used to project into its Add ServiceStack Reference's generated C#, TypeScript, (and other languages) which are also
the same Types that are manipulated when customizing code-generation, gets used to generate .NET Types in memory on Startup with Reflection.Emit. 

Barring any issues with the projection into IL, externally the end result is indistinguishable to a normal code-first ServiceStack Service 
manually created by a developer - An important point as to why these solutions compose well with the rest of ServiceStack, just as an AutoQuery 
Service is a normal ServiceStack Service, these auto generated & auto registered ServiceStack Services are regular Auto Query Services. 
The primary difference is that they only exist in a .NET Assembly in memory created on Startup, not in code so they're not "statically visible" to 
a C# compiler, IDE, tools, etc. But otherwise they're regular typed ServiceStack Services and can take advantage of the ecosystem around Services 
including [Add ServiceStack Reference](/add-servicestack-reference) & other Metadata Pages and Services, etc.

### CreateCrudServices Instructions

Peeking deeper behind the `AutoRegister` flag will reveal that it's a helper for adding an empty `CreateCrudServices` instance, i.e. it's equivalent to:

```csharp
Plugins.Add(new AutoQueryFeature {
    GenerateCrudServices = new GenerateCrudServices {
        CreateServices = {
            new CreateCrudServices()
        }
        //....
    }
});
```

#### Multiple Schemas and RDBMS Connections

This instructs ServiceStack to generate Services for the default option, i.e. all tables in the Database of the default registered Database connection.

Although should you wish to, you can also generate Services for multiple Databases and RDBMS Schemas within the same App.
With this you could have a single API Gateway Servicifying access to multiple System RDBMS Tables & Schemas, e.g:

```csharp
Plugins.Add(new AutoQueryFeature {
    GenerateCrudServices = new GenerateCrudServices {
        CreateServices = {
            new CreateCrudServices(),
            new CreateCrudServices { Schema = "AltSchema" },
            new CreateCrudServices { NamedConnection = "Reporting" },
            new CreateCrudServices { NamedConnection = "Reporting", Schema = "AltSchema" },
        }
        //....
    }
});
```

These will generated Service Contracts & DTO Types with the Multitenancy [NamedConnection](/autoquery/rdbms#named-connection) 
& OrmLite `[Schema]` attribute required for routing AutoQuery Services to use the appropriate RDBMS connection of Schema. 
 
Although there are potential conflicts if there are identical table names in each RDBMS/Schema as it has to go back and rewrite the Metadata References to use a 
non-ambiguous name, first tries using the NamedConnection, then the schema then a combination when both exists, if it's still ambiguous it gives up and ignores it.
If you do run into conflicts, the recommendation is to "eject" the generated `.cs` sources and manually update them to use your preferred unique names.

### Customize Code Generation to include App Conventions

Being able to instantly generate AutoQuery Services for all your RDBMS tables is nice, but it's even nicer if you could easily customize the code-generation!

Together with the flexibility of the new declarative validation support you can compose a surprisingly large amount of your App's logic using the versatility 
of C# to automate embedding your App's conventions by annotating them on declarative Request DTOs.

The existing code-generation already infers a lot from your RDBMS schema which you can further augment using the available `GenerateCrudServices` filters:

 - `ServiceFilter` - called with every Service Operation
 - `TypeFilter` - called with every DTO Type
 - `IncludeService` - a predicate to return whether the **Service** should be included
 - `IncludeType` - a predicate to return whether the **Type** should be included

For an illustration of this in action, here's a typical scenario of how the Northwind AutoQuery Services could be customized:

 - Controlling which Tables **not to generate Services for** in `ignoreTables`
 - Which tables not to generate **Write Crud Services** for in `readOnlyTables`
 - Which tables to **restrict access** to in different roles in `protectTableByRole` 
 - Example of **additional validation** to existing tables in `tableRequiredFields`
   - Adds the `[ValidateNotEmpty]` attribute to Services accessing the table and the `[Required]` OrmLite attribute for the Data Model DTO Type.

```csharp
var ignoreTables = new[] { "IgnoredTable", }; // don't generate AutoCrud APIs for these tables
var readOnlyTables = new[] { "Region" };
var protectTableByRole = new Dictionary<string,string[]> {
    ["Admin"]    = new[] { nameof(CrudEvent), nameof(ValidationRule) },
    ["Accounts"] = new[] { "Order", "Supplier", "Shipper" },
    ["Employee"] = new[] { "Customer", "Order", "OrderDetail" },
    ["Manager"]  = new[] { "Product", "Category", "Employee", "EmployeeTerritory", "UserAuth", "UserAuthDetails" },
};
var tableRequiredFields = new Dictionary<string,string[]> {
    ["Shipper"] = new[]{ "CompanyName", "Phone" },
};

Plugins.Add(new AutoQueryFeature {
    MaxLimit = 100,
    GenerateCrudServices = new GenerateCrudServices
    {
        ServiceFilter = (op,req) => 
        {
            // Require all Write Access to Tables to be limited to Authenticated Users
            if (op.IsCrudWrite())
            {
                op.Request.AddAttributeIfNotExists(new ValidateRequestAttribute("IsAuthenticated"), 
                    x => x.Validator == "IsAuthenticated");
            }

            // Limit Access to specific Tables
            foreach (var tableRole in protectTableByRole)
            {
                foreach (var table in tableRole.Value)
                {
                    if (op.ReferencesAny(table))
                        op.Request.AddAttribute(new ValidateHasRoleAttribute(tableRole.Key));
                }
            }

            // Add [ValidateNotEmpty] attribute on Services operating Tables with Required Fields
            if (op.DataModel != null && tableRequiredFields.TryGetValue(op.DataModel.Name, out var requiredFields))
            {
                var props = op.Request.Properties.Where(x => requiredFields.Contains(x.Name));
                props.Each(x => x.AddAttribute(new ValidateNotEmptyAttribute()));
            }
        },
        TypeFilter = (type, req) => 
        {
            // Add OrmLite [Required] Attribute on Tables with Required Fields
            if (tableRequiredFields.TryGetValue(type.Name, out var requiredFields))
            {
                var props = type.Properties.Where(x => requiredFields.Contains(x.Name));
                props.Each(x => x.AddAttribute(new RequiredAttribute()));
            }
        },
        //Don't generate the Services or Types for Ignored Tables
        IncludeService = op => !ignoreTables.Any(table => op.ReferencesAny(table)) &&
            !(op.IsCrudWrite() && readOnlyTables.Any(table => op.ReferencesAny(table))),

        IncludeType = type => !ignoreTables.Contains(type.Name),
    }
});
```

To assist in code-generation a number of high-level APIs are available to help with identifying Services, e.g:

 - `operation.IsCrud()` - Is read-only AutoQuery or AutoCrud write Service
 - `operation.IsCrudWrite()` - Is AutoCrud write Service
 - `operation.IsCrudRead()` - Is AutoQuery read-only Service
 - `operation.ReferencesAny()` - The DTO Type is referenced anywhere in the Service (e.g. Request/Response DTOs, Inheritance, Generic Args, etc)
 - `type.InheritsAny()` - The DTO inherits any of the specified type names
 - `type.ImplementsAny()` - The DTO implements any of the specified interface type names

### Mixing generated AutoQuery Services & existing code-first Services

The expected use-case for these new features is that you'd create a new project that points to an existing database to bootstrap your project with 
code-first AutoQuery Services using the dotnet tool to download the generated types, i.e:

    $ x csharp https://localhost:5001 -path /crud/all/csharp

At which point you'd "eject" from the generated AutoQuery Services (forgetting about this feature), copy the generated types into your **ServiceModel** 
project and continue on development as code-first Services just as if you'd created the Services manually.

But the `GenerateCrudServices` feature also supports a "hybrid" mode where you can also just generate Services for any **new** AutoQuery Services 
that don't exist, i.e. for tables for which there are no existing services which you can access their generated Services from:

    $ x csharp https://localhost:5001 -path /crud/new/csharp

The existing `/crud/all/csharp` Service continues to return generated Services for all Tables but will stitch together and use existing types where they exist.

### Trying it out

We now have all the features we need to quickly servicify an existing database that we can easily customize to apply custom App logic to further protect & validate access.

So you can quickly explore these new features locally, you can download the enhanced Northwind example with this customization above in the new 
[github.com/NetCoreApps/NorthwindCrud](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/NorthwindCrud) project which you can download & run with:

    $ x download NetCoreApps/NorthwindCrud
    $ cd NorthwindCrud
    $ dotnet run

This example App is also configured with other new features in incoming release including Crud Events in 
[Startup.cs](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/NorthwindCrud/blob/master/Startup.cs):

```csharp
// Add support for auto capturing executable audit history for AutoCrud Services
container.AddSingleton<ICrudEvents>(c => new OrmLiteCrudEvents(c.Resolve<IDbConnectionFactory>()));
container.Resolve<ICrudEvents>().InitSchema();
```

As well as support for dynamically generated db rules in 
[Configure.Validation.cs](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/NorthwindCrud/blob/master/Configure.Validation.cs):

```csharp
services.AddSingleton<IValidationSource>(c => 
    new OrmLiteValidationSource(c.Resolve<IDbConnectionFactory>()));

appHost.Resolve<IValidationSource>().InitSchema();
```

To be able to test the custom code generation the example is pre-populated with 3 users with different roles in 
[Configure.Auth.cs](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/NorthwindCrud/blob/master/Configure.Auth.cs):

```csharp
// Register Users that don't exist
void EnsureUser(string email, string name, string[] roles=null)
{
    if (authRepo.GetUserAuthByUserName(email) != null) 
        return;
    
    authRepo.CreateUserAuth(new UserAuth {
        Email = email,
        DisplayName = name,
        Roles = roles?.ToList(),
    }, password:"p@ss");
}

EnsureUser("employee@gmail.com", name:"A Employee",   roles:new[]{ "Employee" });
EnsureUser("accounts@gmail.com", name:"Account Dept", roles:new[]{ "Employee", "Accounts" });
EnsureUser("manager@gmail.com",  name:"The Manager",  roles:new[]{ "Employee", "Manager" });
```

Of which you can also find published on NorthwindCrud's home page:

### Open in ServiceStack Studio

![](/img/pages/release-notes/v5.9/northwindcrud-home.png)

### Retrying Dart gRPC Example

We can see an immediate effect of these customizations in **NorthwindCrud** where most APIs now require Authentication:

![](/img/pages/release-notes/v5.9/northwindcrud-metadata.png)

If we then try to run our Dart `main.dart` example against the customized **NorthwindCrud** APIs by first regenerating gRPC protoc Types:

    $ x proto-dart https://localhost:5001 -out lib

Then try rerunning `main.dart` where it will now fail with an **Unauthorized** exception:

![](/img/pages/release-notes/v5.9/northwindcrud-noauth.png)

To now be able to access most Services we'll need to [Authenticate as registered user](/grpc/dart#dart-grpc-authenticated-request-example).
As NorthwindCrud is [configured to use JWT](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/NorthwindCrud/blob/master/Configure.Auth.cs) we can create
an Authenticated gRPC client by adding the populated JWT Token from an Authenticated Request into the **Authorization** gRPC metadata Header:

```dart
GrpcServicesClient createClient({CallOptions options}) {
  return GrpcServicesClient(ClientChannel('localhost', port:5054,
    options:ChannelOptions(credentials: ChannelCredentials.insecure())), 
    options:options);
}

void main(List<String> arguments) async {
    var authResponse = await createClient()
        .postAuthenticate(Authenticate()..provider='credentials'
        ..userName='manager@gmail.com'..password='p@ss');

    var authClient = createClient(options:CallOptions(metadata:{ 
        'Authorization': 'Bearer ${authResponse.bearerToken}' }));
    var response = await authClient.getQueryCategory(QueryCategory());
    print(response.results);
    exit(0);
}
```

Now when we rerun `main.dart` we'll be able to access our Northwind categories again:

![](/img/pages/release-notes/v5.9/northwindcrud-jwtauth.png)

## ServiceStack Studio

Thanks to the richer semantics of AutoQuery Services, it's generic interfaces, base class & declarative attributes, ServiceStack has more 
knowledge about your Services than what's possible from normal HTTP API endpoint metadata and is able to provide richer suite of functionality around them.
An example that takes advantage of this is **ServiceStack Studio** - A new Desktop App for accessing your ServiceStack instances.

[![](/img/pages/release-notes/v5.9/studio-home.png)](https://youtu.be/2FFRLxs7orU)


It replaces the [ServiceStack Admin UI](https://github.com/ServiceStack/Admin) where it provides a UX-friendly UI for accessing AutoQuery & Crud Services 
but will also gain UI features for taking advantage of various ServiceStack Plugins & Features, e.g. in this initial release it includes UI's for 
**Managing DB Validation Rules** & for viewing the **Executable Audit History of Tables** updated through AutoCrud Services.

**Studio** is a capability-based Admin UI where it only enables its different management UI's depending on which features each remote ServiceStack Instance 
has enabled & whether the Signed In User has access to them.

To enable this ability a new `/metadata/app` endpoint returns metadata information about which plugins are enabled, what features they're configured 
with and whether they're protected behind User Roles. As such it will only be able to manage ServiceStack instances running the latest v5.9 release.

You'll need the latest [app dotnet tool](/netcore-windows-desktop) which is bundled with the latest Chromium 
which provides the Desktop UI:

    $ dotnet tool update -g app

Which you'll need to run once to register the `app://` url scheme, e.g:

    $ app -version

### Studio Desktop App vs ServiceStack.Admin

The primary limitations with [ServiceStack Admin](https://github.com/ServiceStack/Admin) was its deployment model where it had to be explicitly registered as a plugin in each ServiceStack instance, this means it could only be used on ServiceStack instances that explicitly had it registered, also it maintained the long release cadence of ServiceStack major releases which means the UI couldn't be updated frequently resulting in a stale long feedback loop.

### Frequent out-of-band release cadence

To overcome this ServiceStack Studio is delivered as a [Gist Desktop App](https://sharpscript.net/docs/gist-desktop-apps) which, like a website will be running the latest version each time it's run. To reduce its download footprint the `app` and `x` dotnet tools now include the new [ServiceStack.Desktop](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/tree/master/src/ServiceStack.Desktop) project which includes the common framework libraries that most Vue & React Apps use which saves it from needing to be included in each Download. It also includes Google Material Design Icons SVGs & a copy of [fontawesome free icons](https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/setup/hosting-font-awesome-yourself) that all Desktop Apps will be able to use without the bandwidth cost for using them.

### Light Footprint + Always use latest version

[ServiceStack/Studio](https://github.com/ServiceStack/Studio) is a [vue-lite](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/vue-lite) App that only uses SVG icons as they're small, high-quality at every scale, are customizable & have built-in css classes making them easy to use declaratively where it takes advantage of [ServiceStack's built-in SVG](/svg) support which allows optimal css bundles containing only the SVGs your App's use. All SVG icons used in Studio are defined in its [_init.ss](https://github.com/ServiceStack/Studio/blob/master/wwwroot/_init.ss) startup script which defines which Material Design SVG to make available under which css bundle. It also registers its own custom SVG icons not contained in ServiceStack.Desktop's embedded resources and includes them as part of its `/css/app.css` bundle.

As a result of its architecture Studio gets bundled down to a **55kb .zip** which includes its 46kb (Uncompressed) `Studio.dll` plugin containing all its C# back-end logic (thanks to all ServiceStack .dll's being deployed with the dotnet tools as well). As it's [published as a Gist](https://gist.github.com/gistlyn/d8e7a56027ed6ec3060d9a9896931909) it adds a bit more overhead (and Gist APIs aren't particularly fast) so there's a slight delay in loading from a Gist but still is able to load its home page in around **2-3s**, which includes the start time of the ServiceStack .NET Core App and the Chromium CEF Browser. The number of restarts should be minimal thanks to Studio being designed as a single UI to manage all your ServiceStack instances so you can reuse the same running Desktop App to manage multiple remote ServiceStack instances.

### Desktop Features

Thanks to it being a Desktop App we have features that wouldn't be possible in a Web App, e.g. we can use built-in proxies to by-pass CORS & IFrame embedding limitations to be able to access ServiceStack instances that don't have CORS enabled & native Windows features like easy access to clipboard, launch external programs directly, control Desktop Windows, e.g. Launch into **kiosk** mode or in/out of full-screen with `F11`, etc.

### ServiceStack.Desktop

Studio is powered by exciting new features in the latest `app` .NET Core Desktop App dotnet tool which in addition to its small footprint & able to run "always up-to-date", it also includes seamless integration into invoking server functions with `#Script` which allows you to use the same syntax to call JavaScript functions.

The integration makes it trivial to call **Win32 APIs** from JavaScript which are accessible behind [async TypeScript APIs](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/src/ServiceStack.Desktop/lib/js/%40servicestack/desktop/servicestack-desktop.d.ts) resulting in a much more pleasant API than calling them in C#, e.g. you can Copy + Paste to the Windows clipboard with just:

```ts
import { clipboard, setClipboard } from '@servicestack/desktop'

await setClipboard('Some Text')
await clipboard() //= Some Text
```

The TypeScript APIs are just typed wrappers around calling [DesktopScripts Script Methods](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/src/ServiceStack.Desktop/DesktopScripts.cs) which invoke the the appropriate Win 32 API, e.g:

```ts
async function clipboard() { 
    return await evaluateCode('clipboard'); 
}
```

### win32 demo

The [win32](https://github.com/sharp-apps/win32) Sharp App contains an examples dashboard of invoking different native Win32 functions:

[![](/img/pages/release-notes/v5.9/win32.png)](https://github.com/sharp-apps/win32)

You can run this Gist Desktop App via URL Scheme from:

    [app://win32](app://win32)

Or via command-line:

```
    $ app open win32
```

The main source code of this component is in [Win32/index.ts](https://github.com/sharp-apps/win32/blob/master/src/components/Win32/index.ts),
which makes use of the built in TypeScript APIs below from `@servicestack/desktop`:

```ts
start('%USERPROFILE%\\\\.sharp-apps')

openUrl('https://google.com')

messageBox('The Title', 'Caption', MessageBoxType.YesNo | MessageBoxType.IconInformation)

await openFile(  {
    title: 'Pick Images',
    filter: "Image files (*.png;*.jpeg)|*.png;*.jpeg|All files (*.*)|*.*",
    initialDir: await expandEnvVars('%USERPROFILE%\\\\Pictures'),
    defaultExt: '*.png',
})

openFile({ isFolderPicker: true })

deviceScreenResolution()

primaryMonitorInfo()

windowSetPosition(x, y)

windowSetSize(width, height)
```

#### Custom Win32 API

You're also not limited to calling the built-in Win32 APIs above as calling custom APIs just involves wrapping the C# inside
your preferred [#Script method](https://sharpscript.net/docs/methods) that you would like to make it available to JS as, 
e.g. here's the **win32** implementation for launching [Win32's Color Dialog Box](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dlgbox/color-dialog-box)
and returning the selected color in HTML Color format:

```csharp
public class CustomMethods : ScriptMethods
{
    [DllImport("ComDlg32.dll", CharSet = CharSet.Unicode)]
    internal static extern int CommDlgExtendedError();

    [DllImport("ComDlg32.dll", CharSet = CharSet.Unicode)]
    internal static extern bool ChooseColor(ref ChooseColor cc);
    
    private int[] customColors = new int[16] {
        0x00FFFFFF, 0x00C0C0C0, 0x00808080, 0x00000000,
        0x00FF0000, 0x00800000, 0x00FFFF00, 0x00808000,
        0x0000FF00, 0x00008000, 0x0000FFFF, 0x00008080,
        0x000000FF, 0x00000080, 0x00FF00FF, 0x00800080,
    };

    public string chooseColor(ScriptScopeContext scope) => chooseColor(scope, "#ffffff");

    public string chooseColor(ScriptScopeContext scope, string defaultColor) => scope.DoWindow(w => {
        var cc = new ChooseColor();
        cc.lStructSize = Marshal.SizeOf(cc);
        var lpCustColors = Marshal.AllocCoTaskMem(16 * sizeof(int));
        try
        {
            Marshal.Copy(customColors, 0, lpCustColors,16);
            cc.hwndOwner = w;
            cc.lpCustColors = lpCustColors;
            cc.Flags = ChooseColorFlags.FullOpen | ChooseColorFlags.RgbInit;
            var c = ColorTranslator.FromHtml(defaultColor);
            cc.rgbResult = ColorTranslator.ToWin32(c);

            if (!ChooseColor(ref cc)) 
                return (string) null;
        
            c = ColorTranslator.FromWin32(cc.rgbResult);
            return ColorTranslator.ToHtml(c);
        }
        finally
        {
            Marshal.FreeCoTaskMem(lpCustColors);
        }
    });
}
```

ServiceStack.Desktop's IPC takes care of invoking the `#Script` [JS-compatible expression](https://sharpscript.net/docs/expression-viewer)
and returning the result:

```ts
var selectedColor = await evaluateCode('chooseColor(`#336699`)')
```

[![](/img/pages/release-notes/v5.9/win32-choosecolor.png)](https://github.com/sharp-apps/win32)

The `scope.DoWindow()` extension method supports expressions being invoked in-process when launched by `app.exe` as well as when 
invoked during development in "detached mode" if electing to run the .NET Core backend as a stand-alone Web App.

If your App calls your custom APIs a lot you can wrap it in a first-class TypeScript method that mirrors the server #Script method:

```ts
function chooseColor(defaultColor?:string) {
    return defaultColor
        ? evaluateCode(`chooseColor(${quote(defaultColor)})`)
        : evaluateCode(`chooseColor()`);
}
```

Where it can be called using the same syntax in JS and #Script:

```ts
var selectedColor = await chooseColor(`#336699`)
```

### Highly productive live-reloading Development experience

When running inside an `app` [.NET Core Desktop App](/netcore-windows-desktop) is uses an IPC mode similar to Unix Pipes where communication is streamed over internal processes with the Desktop Scripts invoked by app.exe. To enable an optimal development experience it also supports a decoupled mode where in Debug builds you can launch the `app.exe` Chromium browser to open a remote URL, e.g:

    $ app start https://localhost:5002

Which allows you to develop your Desktop App as a regular .NET Core Web App whilst still being hosted inside the `app` CEF shell which instead of using a Chromium inter-process IPC to invoke `#Script` server functions, will invoke them over https where the Win 32 APIs end up being invoked by the back-end .NET Core Server instead of the `app.exe` Desktop App, but the end result remains the same.

If it weren't for the productivity possible for being able to only needing to develop for Chrome's state-of-the-art rendering engine where you can use advanced features like CSS grid along with the productivity of high-level productive Reactive UI frameworks like Vue, the effort into create a Desktop App like ServiceStack Studio wouldn't be justifiable. Being able to develop in a highly productive environment with hot-reloading and a fast iterative development loop makes all the difference which otherwise wouldn't be feasible if needing to use any C# & XAML UI FX or WinForms to develop Desktop Apps.

A Reactive Vue Desktop App with live-reload brings the enjoyment back to developing Desktop Apps with web development productivity, access to the latest Chrome features & native Windows features when needed.

After the next release we'll create pre-packaged project templates for **vue-desktop** and **react-desktop** Desktop Apps to make it easy develop Vue & React Desktop Apps along with scripts to bundle it & publish it to gist. If preferred `app.exe` also lets you deploy the published app to your own private repo & limit access to only users accessible with a GitHub token which they can open with from a URL with:

    app://user/repo?token={GITHUB_TOKEN}

Or on the command line with:

    $ app user/repo -token $GITHUB_TOKEN

> Or without a token by setting it in the `GITHUB_TOKEN` Environment variable

For offline deployments the published `/dist` folder can be copied and launched with `app` (or `x`) in the app's folder:

    $ app

For better Desktop integration this (or custom command-line arguments) can be wrapped in a new Windows Shortcut:

    $ app shortcut

Anyone wanting an early look at an example of Desktop App projects built using this development model can checkout [ServiceStack/Studio](https://github.com/ServiceStack/Studio) or [NetCoreApps/SharpData](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/SharpData).

### Starting ServiceStack Studio

The initial release of ServiceStack Studio primarily provides a UI around AutoQuery Services and the latest features in this release like 
**Executable Audit History** and declarative **RDBMS validators**.

If you don't have a project using the latest v5.9 features on hand you can launch a copy of [NetCoreApps/NorthwindCrud](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/NorthwindCrud) which uses the new AutoCrud features to generate AutoQuery Services around all its RDBMS tables, that can be run locally with:

    $ x download NetCoreApps/NorthwindCrud
    $ cd NorthwindCrud
    $ dotnet run

Where you can use `app` URL scheme support to launch **Studio** & automatically register the **NorthwindCrud** instance with:

<p><a href="app://studio?connect=https://localhost:5001">app://studio?connect=https://localhost:5001</a></p>

This URL scheme gets translated & is equivalent to running **Studio** on the command-line with:

    $ app open studio -connect https://localhost:5001

Which downloads the [Studio Gist Desktop App](https://gist.github.com/gistlyn/d8e7a56027ed6ec3060d9a9896931909), loads it as a [Gist VFS](/virtual-file-system#gistvirtualfiles) whose static assets are then served by the .NET Core Server and loaded in the CEF Chromium browser.

The `connect` param is used by **Studio** to auto register the remote **NorthwindCrud** instance where it auto downloads its App Metadata 
containing its enabled plugins & features & within a few seconds you should see it appear on the home page:

![](/img/pages/release-notes/v5.9/studio-home.png)

#### Desktop-less x-plat app

Whilst not optimized for it, **Studio** can also be launched headless in your default Browser using the `x` x-plat tool:

<p><a href="xapp://studio?connect=https://localhost:5001">xapp://studio?connect=https://localhost:5001</a></p>

    $ x open studio -connect https://localhost:5001

Where you'll then be able to view it by going to `https://localhost:5002`. Note if not launched in a browser **Studio** will have limited 
capacity and features, but will eventually be a supported mode for accessing **Studio** from macOS or Linux.

### Home Page

From the home page you'll see all the top-level Admin Sections available that's enabled on the remote instance, in the initial release there's a UI for accessing AutoQuery Services and a UI for maintaining DB Validation Rules.

### AutoQuery UI

Because of the rich declarative metadata of AutoQuery & Crud Services we can infer the data model that each AutoQuery Service operates on 
and the Type of Operation each Service provides. As a result can logically group each Service around the Data Model they operate on and 
provide a more intuitive & natural UI for each of the different AutoQuery/CRUD operation types.

![](/img/pages/release-notes/v5.9/autoquery-noauth.png)


What UI features & tables are visible is reflected by whether the AutoQuery Service for that type exists and whether the currently 
authenticated User has access to them (i.e. Have the role required by each Service). So an unauthenticated user will see Northwind Crud's 
read-only **Region** table with no ability to update it & the **Territory** table, which as it isn't protected by a role will be visible to everyone, 
but as all CRUD Write operations require authentication, all edit controls require authentication - where we can see in the screenshot above,
are replaced with **Sign In** buttons.

Here are the relevant [NorthwindCrud auto-generation rules](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/NorthwindCrud/blob/master/Startup.cs) which defines this behavior:

```csharp
var readOnlyTables = new[] { "Region" };
GenerateCrudServices = new GenerateCrudServices {
    ServiceFilter = (op,req) => {
        // Require all Write Access to Tables to be limited to Authenticated Users
        if (op.IsCrudWrite())
        {
            op.Request.AddAttributeIfNotExists(new ValidateRequestAttribute("IsAuthenticated"), 
                x => x.Validator == "IsAuthenticated");
        }
    },
    //Don't generate the Services or Types for Ignored Tables
    IncludeService = op => !ignoreTables.Any(table => op.ReferencesAny(table)) &&
        !(op.IsCrudWrite() && readOnlyTables.Any(table => op.ReferencesAny(table))),
}
```

Clicking on any of the **Auth** icons or the **Sign In** button on the top right will open up the Sign In dialog.

### Integrated Auth Component

![](/img/pages/release-notes/v5.9/auth.png)

The **Sign In** dialog supports most of ServiceStack's built-in Auth Providers with a different Auth Dialog tab depending which Auth Providers are enabled. 
It looks at "auth family type" to determine how to Authenticate with each Auth Provider so it should still support your Custom Auth Providers if they 
inherit from existing Auth Providers, otherwise they can explicitly specify which Type of Auth they use by overriding the `Type` property getter with 
one of the following:

  - **Bearer** - Authenticate with HTTP Authentication Bearer Token (e.g. JWT or API Key)
  - **credentials** - Authenticate with Username/Password at `/auth/credentials`
  - **oauth** - Authenticate with OAuth
  - **session** - Alternative [session-based Auth Provider](/auth/authentication-and-authorization#session-authentication-overview)

The **session** tab is also displayed if a `credentials` or `auth` provider is enabled. It should serve as a fallback Auth option if your 
Custom Auth Provider doesn't fit into the existing family types as it opens the `/auth` page of the remote ServiceStack instance:

![](/img/pages/release-notes/v5.9/auth-session.png)

Where you can login to the remote site via the new fallback `/login` page or uses your custom Login Page if exists. 
If your remote instance is configured to allow Studio CORS access, i.e:

```csharp
appHost.Plugins.Add(new CorsFeature(allowOriginWhitelist:new[]{ "https://localhost:5002" }));
```

Clicking on the **copy** button will then be able to post the session Id back to Studio & close the auth popup otherwise you'd need to 
manually close the popup and paste the session in.

![](/img/pages/release-notes/v5.9/auth-session-copy.png)

The **OAuth** tab is a little different since it requires an OAuth redirect and since most 3rd Party OAuth providers disallow embedding in iframes,
it needs to popup an external url in your default browser which still provides a nice auth UX as you'd typically already be Signed In with your 
Default browser, where it will redirect you back to your `/auth` page where you can copy either the **Session Id** or the OAuth **Access Token** 
if you enable including OAuth Access Tokens in your `AuthenticateResponse` DTO with:

```csharp
appHost.Plugins.Add(new AuthFeature(...) {
    IncludeOAuthTokensInAuthenticateResponse = true, // Include OAuth Keys in authenticated /auth page
});
```

This allows you to [Authenticate via OAuth Access Token](/auth/authentication-and-authorization#authentication-via-oauth-accesstokens) where you can test 
the same Authentication that Mobile and Desktop using pre-existing Sign In Widgets who also authenticate via OAuth Access Tokens obtained by their native UI widget:

![](/img/pages/release-notes/v5.9/auth-page.png)

**Studio** is able to provide a seamless UX where it's able to monitor the Windows clipboard for changes & when detected close the window, return focus back to Studio who uses it to automatically Sign In with the copied token.

### Desktop User State & Preferences

As is expected from a normal Desktop App, the User State of the App is preserved across restarts, which Studio maintains in its `$HOME/.servicestack/studio/site.settings` JSON file which preserves amongst other things what remote ServiceStack instances you've connected to & last queries made on each table, etc. When 
not running in a Desktop App it will save it to your browsers `localStorage`. You can force a save with `Ctrl+S` or by clicking on the **save icon** on the top right.

### AutoCrud Querying

The same querying behavior, supported filters, custom fields, paging, order by's, etc. demonstrated in **SharpData** above are also available in **Studio**, 
but implemented differently, where instead of calling the SharpData API directly, the filters are translated into the equivalent AutoQuery request and 
the remote AutoQuery Services are called instead, but as they both result in the same UX and end result, users knowledge is transferable:

#### Search Filters

 - Use `=null` or `!=null` to search `NULL` columns
 - Use `<=`, `<`, `>`, `>=`, `<>`, `!=` prefix to search with that operator
 - Use `,` trailing comma to perform an `IN (values)` search (integer columns only)
 - Use `%` suffix or prefix to perform a `LIKE` search

![](/img/pages/release-notes/v5.9/studio-query-filters.png)

### Export to Excel

Likewise the fast, direct export into Excel is also available, one difference is that the total results returned in a query is controlled by the remote
ServiceStack AutoQuery plugin whereas **SharpData** allows for unlimited sized queries:

![](/img/pages/release-notes/v5.9/studio-excel.png)

### AutoCrud Partial Updates

The UI is designed to look similar to a generic RDBMS Admin UI Table Editor where you can edit records in a table grid. If a `IPatchDb<Table>` 
AutoQuery Service exists for the Data Model & the Authenticated User has access to it. 

If enabled all fields (excl PK) on that Request DTO will be editable in the UI, otherwise they'll appear Read-only like the **Id** column:

![](/img/pages/release-notes/v5.9/studio-crud-partial.png)

### AutoCrud Create

If the user has access to the `ICreateDb<Table>` Service they'll be able to add records by clicking the *+* icon on the top-right of the resultset which brings up the Create Entity modal:

![](/img/pages/release-notes/v5.9/studio-crud-create.png)

### AutoCrud Update and Delete

If the user has access to the `IUpdateDb<Table>` Service they'll be able to update records by clicking on the **edit** icon which will bring up the Edit Entity dialog. If they have access to the `IDeleteDb<Table>` Service they'll also be able to delete the entity from the same screen:

![](/img/pages/release-notes/v5.9/studio-crud-update.png)

### API Log Viewer

All API Requests the UI makes to remote ServiceStack instances are made via a generic .NET Core back-end Service Proxy which attaches the Signed In Authentication Info to each Request. Each API Request Studio makes is recorded in the log viewer at the bottom, showing the Verb and Parameters each API was called with:

![](/img/pages/release-notes/v5.9/studio-request-log.png)

> You can copy the URL from **GET** API Requests or open them up in a new browser to view it in isolation. 

### Executable Audit History

If you Sign In as the **Admin** User (i.e. using `AuthSecret=zsecret`) you'll get super user access to access the other protected features like 
being able to view an **Audit History** of updates made to each record via AutoQuery that's enabled in **NorthwindCrud** with:

```csharp
// Add support for auto capturing executable audit history for AutoCrud Services
container.AddSingleton<ICrudEvents>(c => new OrmLiteCrudEvents(c.Resolve<IDbConnectionFactory>()));
container.Resolve<ICrudEvents>().InitSchema();
```

Where users in the `AutoQueryFeature.AccessRole` (default: Admin) role will be able to view the Audit history of each row:

![](/img/pages/release-notes/v5.9/studio-audit.png)

> If creating & deleting an entity with the same Id, the Audit History of the previous entity will be retained & visible

### Validators UI

As an **Admin** you'll also have access to the [DB Validation Source](https://forums.servicestack.net/t/autocrud-preview/8298/29?u=mythz) Admin UI which will let you add declarative Type and Property Validators for each Request DTO in Studio. This is enabled in NorthwindCrud in [Configure.Validation.cs](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/NorthwindCrud/blob/master/Configure.Validation.cs):

```csharp
// Add support for dynamically generated db rules
services.AddSingleton<IValidationSource>(c => 
    new OrmLiteValidationSource(c.Resolve<IDbConnectionFactory>()));

//...
appHost.Plugins.Add(new ValidationFeature());
appHost.Resolve<IValidationSource>().InitSchema();
```

Management of this feature is limited to users in the `ValidationFeature.AccessRole` (default: Admin).

Clicking on the Validation **Lock Icon** on the top right will take you to the Validation Editor for that AutoQuery Request DTO which will include quick links to jump to different AutoQuery/Crud Services for the same Data Model.

In the validation editor you'll be able to create **Type** and **Property** Validation Rules that either make use of an existing **Validator** or you can enter a custom `#Script` expression that must validate to `true`. The Validator UI is smart and will list all built-in and Custom Script Methods returning `ITypeValidator` or `IPropertyValidator` that's registered in the remote instance. The pre-defined list of validators are displayed in a list of "quick pick" buttons that enables fast adding/editing of validation rules.

#### Verified Rules

The `ModifyValidationRules` Service that Studio calls performs a lot of validation to ensure the Validation rule is accurate including executing the validator to make sure it returns the appropriate validator type and checking the syntax on any **Script** validation rules to ensure it's valid.

![](/img/pages/release-notes/v5.9/studio-validator-property.png)

![](/img/pages/release-notes/v5.9/studio-db-validators.png)

The `ModifyValidationRules` back-end Service also takes care of invalidating the validation rule cache so that any saved Validators are immediately applied. 
Despite being sourced from a DB, after the first access the validation rules are cached in memory where they'd have similar performance to validators declaratively 
added on Request DTOs in code.

After you add your validation rules you will be able to click the **AutoQuery** icon on the top right to return to the AutoQuery editor. Be mindful of what Validation Rule you're adding to which DTO, e.g. a validation rule added to **CreateCategory** Service will only be applied to that Service which is used when creating entities, e,g. not for full entity or partial field updates.

![](/img/pages/release-notes/v5.9/studio-validators-create.png)

### Future Updates

We hope this provides a quick glimpse into ServiceStack Studio that you'll find useful. Currently this release focused on getting the foundational architecture pieces in place that makes it possible for Studio to enable its compatibility-based UI with the metadata of the different plugins & features & their access roles.

Thanks to the productive workflow of an integrated .NET Core Chromium Desktop App updates will be able to frequently continue out-of-band of ServiceStack releases where they'll be immediately available after the next time the Studio is run. Currently on the TODO list will be to implement richer edit UIs where we should be able to use more optimal input controls as we have the type information of every field. Also planned is proving a better UI for invoking ServiceStack APIs than a generic 
HTTP API UI like Postman as we have richer metadata about each API and access to the richer functionality around ServiceStack Services.

**Studio** should be considered to be in beta at least until v5.10 where it's likely additional changes will be needed in the App Metadata as more UI features are implemented. Any feedback is welcome in the [Customer Forums](https://forums.servicestack.net) where they should be quickly resolved.

### Metadata App Export / Discovery

The way a generic capability-based Admin UI's like Studio is possible is via the `/metadata/app` API descriptor which describes what 
plugins and features are enabled on the remote ServiceStack instance. All built-in plugins which provide functionality that can be
remotely accessed add their info to the App's metadata. 

This functionality is also available to your own plugins should you wish to attach info about your plugin where you can use the 
`AddToAppMetadata` extension method to return a populated `CustomPlugin` DTO describing the features made available by your plugin:

```csharp
public class MyPlugin : IPlugin
{
    public void Register(IAppHost appHost)
    {
        appHost.AddToAppMetadata(meta => {
            meta.CustomPlugins[nameof(MyPlugin)] = new CustomPlugin {
                AccessRole = RoleNames.AllowAnyUser,                   // Required Role to access Services
                ServiceRoutes = new Dictionary<string, string[]> {
                    { nameof(MyPluginService), new[] { "/myplugin/{Id}" } }, // Available Plugin Services
                },
                Enabled = new List<string> { "feature1", "feature2" }, // What plugin features are enabled
                Meta = new Dictionary<string, string> {
                    ["custom"] = "meta" // additional custom metadata you want returned for this plugin
                }
            };
        });
    }
}
```

## AutoQuery

By default all AutoQuery Requests execute all requests using OrmLite's async DB APIs, this can be toggled at a global level to
have all AutoQuery requests use sync APIs if there are any bugs or performance issues with ADO.NET's providers async implementations.

E.g. As MySql and SQLite ADO.NET providers do not yet have a "true" async implementations they'd benefit from using Sync APIs 
which would incur less overhead than their current "async over sync" implementations:

```csharp
Plugins.Add(new AutoQueryFeature {
    EnableAsync = false
})
```

To increase the versatility of using AutoQuery functionality in custom Service implementations, there's now parallel Sync and Async APIs 
if needing to enlist AutoQuery functionality in Sync methods that are unable to be refactored to use the async APIs:

```csharp
public interface IAutoQueryDb : IAutoCrudDb
{
    // Generic API to resolve the DB Connection to use for this request
    IDbConnection GetDb<From>(IRequest req = null);

    // Generate a populated and Typed OrmLite SqlExpression using the same model as the source and output target
    SqlExpression<From> CreateQuery<From>(IQueryDb<From> dto, Dictionary<string, string> dynamicParams, 
        IRequest req = null, IDbConnection db = null);

    // Execute an OrmLite SqlExpression using the same model as the source and output target
    QueryResponse<From> Execute<From>(IQueryDb<From> model, SqlExpression<From> query, 
        IRequest req = null, IDbConnection db = null);

    // Async Execute an OrmLite SqlExpression using the same model as the source and output target
    Task<QueryResponse<From>> ExecuteAsync<From>(IQueryDb<From> model, SqlExpression<From> query, 
        IRequest req = null, IDbConnection db = null);

    // Generate a populated and Typed OrmLite SqlExpression using different models for source and output target
    SqlExpression<From> CreateQuery<From, Into>(IQueryDb<From,Into> dto, Dictionary<string,string> dynamicParams, 
        IRequest req = null, IDbConnection db = null);

    // Execute an OrmLite SqlExpression using different models for source and output target
    QueryResponse<Into> Execute<From, Into>(IQueryDb<From, Into> model, SqlExpression<From> query, 
        IRequest req = null, IDbConnection db = null);

    // Async Execute an OrmLite SqlExpression using different models for source and output target
    Task<QueryResponse<Into>> ExecuteAsync<From, Into>(IQueryDb<From, Into> model, SqlExpression<From> query, 
        IRequest req = null, IDbConnection db = null);
}
```

The `IAutoQueryDb` inherits the new `IAutoCrudDb` APIs below and can access both AutoQuery and CRUD functionality. 

Likewise the new AutoQuery Crud APIs also have sync & async implementations:

```csharp
public interface IAutoCrudDb
{
    // Inserts new entry into Table
    object Create<Table>(ICreateDb<Table> dto, IRequest req);
    
    // Inserts new entry into Table Async
    Task<object> CreateAsync<Table>(ICreateDb<Table> dto, IRequest req);
    
    // Updates entry into Table
    object Update<Table>(IUpdateDb<Table> dto, IRequest req);
    
    // Updates entry into Table Async
    Task<object> UpdateAsync<Table>(IUpdateDb<Table> dto, IRequest req);
    
    // Partially Updates entry into Table (Uses OrmLite UpdateNonDefaults behavior)
    object Patch<Table>(IPatchDb<Table> dto, IRequest req);
    
    // Partially Updates entry into Table Async (Uses OrmLite UpdateNonDefaults behavior)
    Task<object> PatchAsync<Table>(IPatchDb<Table> dto, IRequest req);
    
    // Deletes entry from Table
    object Delete<Table>(IDeleteDb<Table> dto, IRequest req);
    
    // Deletes entry from Table Async
    Task<object> DeleteAsync<Table>(IDeleteDb<Table> dto, IRequest req);

    // Inserts or Updates entry into Table
    object Save<Table>(ISaveDb<Table> dto, IRequest req);

    // Inserts or Updates entry into Table Async
    Task<object> SaveAsync<Table>(ISaveDb<Table> dto, IRequest req);
}
```

Due to its internal pre-defined behavior, AutoQuery CRUD custom Service implementations have limited customizability over its implementation
but still allows you to apply custom logic like apply Custom Filter Attributes, include additional validation, augment the Response DTO, etc.

E.g. This implementation applies the `[ConnectionInfo]` behavior to all its Services which will instead execute queries on the registered 
**Reporting** named connection:

```csharp
[ConnectionInfo(NamedConnection = "Reporting")]
public class MyReportingServices(IAutoQueryDb autoQuery) : Service
{
    public Task<object> Any(CreateReport request) => AutoQuery.CreateAsync(request, base.Request);
}
```

#### Resolve and Inject DB Connection

There's a minor optimization existing custom AutoQuery implementations can do by passing in the resolved `IDbConnection`, saving
`CreateQuery` and `Execute*` APIs from resolving it both themselves or when wanting to use a custom DB Connection resolution for a specific Service:

```csharp
// Sync
public object Any(QueryRockstars query)
{
    using var db = autoQuery.GetDb(query, base.Request);
    var q = autoQuery.CreateQuery(query, base.Request, db);
    return await autoQuery.Execute(query, q, base.Request, db);
}
```

Another optimization if using SQL Server or PostgreSQL RDBMS's is to refactor it to use their native async implementations, e.g:

```csharp
// Async
public async Task<object> Any(QueryRockstars query)
{
    using var db = autoQuery.GetDb(query, base.Request);
    var q = autoQuery.CreateQuery(query, base.Request, db);
    return await autoQuery.ExecuteAsync(query, q, base.Request, db);
}
```

### New AutoQuery Conventions

The new implicit AutoQuery conventions below can be used in all AutoQuery Services:

 - `%IsNull` - (e.g. `FieldIsNull`) return results where Field is **NULL**
 - `%IsNotNull` - (e.g. `FieldIsNotNull`) return results where Field is **NOT NULL**
 - `<>%` - (e.g. `<>Field=value`) return results where Field does **not equal value**.

### CsvFormat

[CSV Format](/csv-format) responses can use the same [scoped custom responses as JSON](/customize-json-responses) to allow
Typed Results to exclude default values columns when returning limited [custom fields with `?fields`](/autoquery/rdbms#custom-fields):

 - Camel Humps Notation: `?jsconfig=edv`
 - Full configuration: `?jsconfig=ExcludeDefaultValues`

## gRPC code-first Development

The development experience of gRPC Services continue to benefit from ServiceStack's code-first gRPC Services enabled by
[protobuf-net.Grpc](https://github.com/protobuf-net/protobuf-net.Grpc) where instead of imposing the high maintenance burden of 
manually authoring `.proto` to define gRPC Services on the developer and resulting in awkward generated classes in both
the C# Service implementation as well as the protoc generated clients.

A code-first development approach allows use of the higher-level & more expressive power of C# & its rich static analysis 
to intuitively declare exactly the Service you want to provide. 

E.g. an AutoQuery Service uses both inheritance and generic response Types is simply declared in a single C# Request DTO
with exactly what querying features you want to be discoverable for this Service:

```csharp
public class QueryCategory : QueryDb<Category>
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string CategoryName { get; set; }
}
```

Which you could call in an end-to-end API without code-gen, using the smart [C# Generic gRPC Service Client](/grpc/generic) 
which supports protobuf-net high-level retrofitted support for both inheritance and generic responses:

```csharp
var response = await client.GetAsync(new QueryCategory { CategoryName = "Vegetables" });
```

But as `.proto` doesn't natively support either inheritance or generic classes the proto clients generates an unusable and awkward 
**has** vs **is a** base for the retrofitted inheritance message hack requiring every base message type to define every possible subtype 
message. The pursuit of a better dev UX inspired us to create the [Dynamic gRPC Requests](/grpc#dynamic-grpc-requests) feature, 
enabling the more natural and UX-friendly way to invoke Services using a flattened unstructured string Dictionary, 
akin to a `?QueryString` in HTTP Requests:

```csharp
var response = await client.GetDynamicQueryCategoryAsync(new DynamicRequest {
    Params = {
        { "CategoryName", "Vegetables" }, 
        { "OrderBy", "Id" }, 
        { "Include", "Total" },
    }
});
```

This feature also allows you to construct a generic `DynamicRequest` Request Message that can invoke any Service making it
useful in scenarios where you want to dynamically construct & invoke different Services like in a Request Query Builder 
as done in **Studio** and **SharpData** UIs, but is no longer required for invoking AutoQuery Services from protoc clients.

### Flattened Request Hierarchy's

To improve support for [protoc generated Service Clients](/grpc#public-grpc-protoc-service-and-ui) Request DTOs now automatically flatten
multiple inheritance hierarchy's into a single message type in the dynamically generated `.proto` gRPC Services description 
so now the C# `QueryCategory` Service above will elide the inheritance tree and expose it as a flattened Service message containing both 
implicit base functionality available to all AutoQuery Services together with the explicit Querying functionality specific for each AutoQuery Service. 

Now the above `QueryCategory` AutoQuery Service above are defined in the generated gRPC `.proto` as:

```csharp
service GrpcServices {
    rpc GetQueryCategory(QueryCategory) returns (QueryResponse_Category) {}
}

message QueryCategory {
   int32 Skip = 1;
   int32 Take = 2;
   string OrderBy = 3;
   string OrderByDesc = 4;
   string Include = 5;
   string Fields = 6;
   map<string,string> Meta = 7;
   int64 Id = 201;
   string CategoryName = 202;
}

message QueryResponse_Category {
   int32 Offset = 1;
   int32 Total = 2;
   repeated Category Results = 3;
   map<string,string> Meta = 4;
   ResponseStatus ResponseStatus = 5;
}
```

This enables protoc generated clients with the more optimal generated typed API for calling ServiceStack's AutoQuery Services down to:

```dart
// Dart
var response = await client.getQueryCategory(QueryCategory()..categoryName='Vegetables');
print(response.results);
```

## Single Page App Templates

All [Single Page App Templates](/templates/single-page-apps) have been upgraded to their latest framework libraries versions:

| .NET Core C# Templates ||
|:---|:---|
| [angular-spa](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/angular-spa)    | .NET Core 3.1 Angular 9 CLI Bootstrap App |
| [aurelia-spa](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/aurelia-spa)    | .NET Core 3.1 Aurelia CLI Bootstrap App |
| [react-lite](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/react-lite)      | .NET Core 3.1 simple + lite (npm-free) React SPA using TypeScript |
| [react-spa](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/react-spa)        | .NET Core 3.1 React Create App CLI Bootstrap App |
| [vue-lite](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/vue-lite)          | .NET Core 3.1 simple + lite (npm-free) Vue SPA using TypeScript |
| [vue-nuxt](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/vue-nuxt)          | .NET Core 3.1 Nuxt.js SPA App with Bootstrap |
| [vue-spa](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/vue-spa)            | .NET Core 3.1 Vue CLI Bootstrap App |
| [vuetify-nuxt](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/vuetify-nuxt)  | .NET Core 3.1 Nuxt.js SPA App with Material Vuetify |
| [vuetify-spa](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/vuetify-spa)    | .NET Core 3.1 Vue CLI App with Material Vuetify |
| [angular-lite-spa](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/angular-lite-spa) | .NET Core 3.1 Angular 4 Material Design Lite Webpack App |

They've also all been converted to use the new `EnableSpaFallback` feature:

```csharp
Plugins.Add(new SharpPagesFeature {
    EnableSpaFallback = true
})
```

Which replaces the previous explicit `[FallbackRoute]` Service with the built-in one below for returning the home page for any unknown HTML requests 
to enable SPA routing on the client:

```csharp
[FallbackRoute("/{PathInfo*}", Matches="AcceptsHtml"), ExcludeMetadata]
public class SpaFallback : IReturn<string>
{
    public string PathInfo { get; set; }
}

[DefaultRequest(typeof(SpaFallback))]
public class SpaFallbackService : Service
{
    //Return index.html for unmatched requests so routing is handled on client
    public object Any(SpaFallback request) => Request.GetPageResult("/");
}
```

### Vue & React "Lite" Project Templates

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/Assets/master/csharp-templates/vue-lite.png)

The "maximum-simplified" npm-free [vue-lite](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/vue-lite) and [react-lite](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/react-lite)
Project templates are now even lighter where instead of needing the **bootstrap.css** or Vue framework library `*.js` assets on disk we can instead 
[reference the official pre-minified assets](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/vue-lite/blob/master/wwwroot/_layout.html) embedded in **ServiceStack.Desktop.dll**:

::: v-pre
```js
{{ [
    `/lib/js/vue/vue.min.js`,
    `/lib/js/vue-router/vue-router.min.js`,
    `/lib/js/vue-class-component/vue-class-component.min.js`,
    `/lib/js/vue-property-decorator/vue-property-decorator.min.js`,
    `/lib/js/@servicestack/client/servicestack-client.min.js`,
    `/lib/js/@servicestack/vue/servicestack-vue.min.js`,
] |> map => `<script src="${it}"></script>` |> joinln |> raw }}
```
:::

This allows faster and simplified updates and deployments which automatically takes care of updating to the latest framework library stable versions 
when upgrading to a newer ServiceStack release. This approach is also compatible with ServiceStack Desktop Apps and reduces the effort in wrapping your
App into a [Gist Desktop App](https://sharpscript.net/docs/gist-desktop-apps) should you wish to offer a Desktop version of it in future.

This greatly reduces the payload size of [wwwroot](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/vue-lite/tree/master/wwwroot) assets where the only library assets 
that need to exist on disk are their dev-only `*.d.ts` TypeScript declarations in [typings](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/vue-lite/tree/master/typings)
which provides the rich intelli-sense and static analysis when developing with TypeScript.

Deployments have also been simplified where now no explicit step is needed to compile your App's client assets as they're now 
automatically bundled, minified & hashed as part of the project's **Bundle** task:

```xml
<Target Name="Bundle" BeforeTargets="AfterPublish">
    <Exec Command="x run _bundle.ss -to /bin/Release/netcoreapp3.1/publish/wwwroot" />
</Target>
```

Where it's implicitly run when publishing the .NET Core App:

    $ dotnet publish -c Release

## `#Script`

As it's becoming an integral part of ServiceStack's newer more versatile features there's now a
`ScriptContext` available in all ServiceStack AppHost's which either uses your AppHost's configured `SharpPagesFeature` if it
has one, otherwise uses an empty fallback `DefaultScriptContext`.

The new APIs allows your App to easily invoke scripting functionality from a free-form string expression that has access to all 
built-in and [registered #Script features](https://sharpscript.net/docs/introduction#net-usage).

So if you had your own custom rules engine with a dynamic source of user-defined business validation rules you could
easily dynamically resolve them to construct a list of Fluent Validation `IPropertyValidator`, e.g:

```csharp
var propertyRules = new[] { "InclusiveBetween(13,100)" };
var validators = propertyRules.Map(rule => 
    (IPropertyValidator) HostContext.AppHost.EvalExpressionCached(rule));
```

Using the `EvalExpressionCached` API ensures that only the minimum number of validator instances are created & subsequently cached for fast access.

The `IScriptValue` Eval APIs allow you to create your own super enhanced Attributes like `[AutoDefault]`, `[AutoFilter]` and `[AutoPopulate]`
where they're able to declaratively define any kind of value that can be statically embedded in a compile-time static C# Attribute declaration.

It also allows custom APIs to accept a single `ScriptValue` Type that can resolve to any kind of value, captured at their optimal performance:

```csharp
HostContext.AppHost.EvalScriptValueAsync(new ScriptValue {
    Value = 10,                      // constant value
    Expression = "date(2001,01,01)", // constant expression
                                     // evaluate dynamic expression
    Eval = "dbSelect('SELECT * FROM Table WHERE Id=@Id', { Id })"
 }, new Dictionary<string,object> { ["Id"] = id })
```

These new `#Script` APIs are available in your AppHost at:

```csharp
public interface IAppHost
{
    // Global #Script ScriptContext for AppHost. Returns SharpPagesFeature or DefaultScriptContext
    ScriptContext ScriptContext { get; }

    // Evaluate Expressions in ServiceStack's ScriptContext.
    // Can be overridden if you want to customize how different expressions are evaluated
    object EvalExpression(string expr);

    // Evaluate Expressions in ServiceStack's ScriptContext.
    // Can be overridden if you want to customize how different expressions are evaluated
    object EvalExpressionCached(string expr);

    // Evaluate a script value, `IScriptValue.Expression` results are cached globally.
    // If `IRequest` is provided, results from the same `IScriptValue.Eval` are cached per request
    object EvalScriptValue(IScriptValue scriptValue, IRequest req=null, 
        Dictionary<string, object> args=null);

    // Evaluate a script value, `IScriptValue.Expression` results are cached globally.
    // If `IRequest` is provided, results from the same `IScriptValue.Eval` are cached per request
    Task<object> EvalScriptValueAsync(IScriptValue scriptValue, IRequest req=null, 
        Dictionary<string,object> args=null);
}
```

### Reclaiming `=` operator for assignment expressions

In its quest to provide a familiar and easy to use scripting language for .NET [#Script](https://sharpscript.net/) added some enhancements 
to JavaScript expressions such as being able to use [SQL-Like Boolean Expressions](https://sharpscript.net/docs/syntax#sql-like-boolean-expressions) 
like `=`, `and` and `or` inside a boolean expression, e.g:

```js
[0,1,2,3,4,5] |> where => (it = 2 or it = 3) and it.isOdd()
```

In modern JS (ES6+) this would be written as:

```js
[0,1,2,3,4,5].filter(it => (it == 2 || it == 3) && isOdd(it));
```

### Breaking Change

By default the use of the single `=` is **now treated as an Assignment operator** as it is in JS so you will need to update any of your boolean expressions 
using it to use the standard `==` equality operator instead, e.g:

```js
[0,1,2,3,4,5] |> where => (it == 2 or it == 3) and it.isOdd()
```

If you're not ready to update your scripts you can revert to the previous behavior and retain treating `=` as equality with:

```csharp
ScriptConfig.AllowAssignmentExpressions = false;
```

### JS familiarity over enhanced human-friendly syntax

At the time we valued human-friendly syntax over JS compatibility however over the years it's become clearer that language familiarity is more important than enhanced human-friendly syntax as it makes it much easier for devs who knows JS (i.e. most) to use `#Script`. Keeping compatibility with JS syntax also helps in other areas like code portability, JS tooling and syntax highlighters and linters, etc. 

JS compatibility was the primary motivation for [transitioning to the Pipe Forward operator](/releases/v5_7#transition-to-js-pipeline-operator-syntax) whose future incorporation into JS will have a lot less friction then continuing to use the unix pipe `|` operator.

The Pipe Forward operator makes it more obvious that the **output of the left expression** is passed as the **input of the right target** which needs to be either a [script method](https://sharpscript.net/docs/methods) or a [filter transformer](https://sharpscript.net/docs/transformers#filter-transformers) however it could be forgiven to [confuse it as an assignment expression](https://forums.servicestack.net/t/virtualfilesystem-for-script-page/7971/5?u=mythz) where the output of the left expression was assigned to the `sliders` variable:

::: v-pre
```hbs
{{ dirFiles('img/sliders') |> sliders }}
```


The mistake here was that it needs to be piped to the `to` (or `toGlobal`) script method which assigns it to the `sliders` local scope argument:

```hbs
{{ dirFiles('img/sliders') |> to => sliders }}
```
:::

### Local Variables

As #Script's variable declaration & assignment is the most common expression foreign to JS devs, we've decided to add support for it 
where you can now use JS syntax to assign a variable, e.g:

```js
var sliders = dirFiles('img/sliders')
```

Like JS you can use either `var`, `let` or `const` but they all behave like `let` and assign a locally scoped variable at the time the expression is executed.

Also like JS the semicolon is optional and you can assign multiple variables in a single expression:

```js
let a = 1 + 2, b = 3 * 4, c, d = 'D';
```

One semantic difference is that variable declarations are still an "Expression" in `#Script`, albeit one that returns a discarded result whilst they're a "Statement" in JS, although this distinction doesn't mean much in practice.

### Global Variables

Global Variables in `#Script` are maintained in the `PageResult.Args` dictionary which you could previously assign to using the `toGlobal` script method
where it's accessible to all scripts rendered within that `PageResult`. 

`#Script` now mimics JS's behavior to allow assignment expressions to assign global variables where "Assignment Expressions" on undeclared variables (i.e. where no locally scoped variable exists) will assign a global variable:

```js
a = 1
```

A more descriptive syntax available to declare a global variable is to assign it to the `global` object (inspired by node's [global](https://nodejs.org/api/globals.html#globals_global)) which is an alias to the `PageResult.Args` dictionary:

```js
global.a = 1
```

> Note: Like most languages assignment expressions in `#Script` return the assigned value which can be discarded with `|> end`.

### Assignment Expressions

In addition to declaring and assigning variables, there's also support for using assignment expressions to assign and mutate Collections and Type Properties using either Member Expression or Index expression syntax, e.g:

```js
intList[1] = 10
stringArray[1] = "foo"
stringMap["foo"] = "bar"
person.Age = 27
objectMap.Person.Name = "kurt"
objectMap['Per' + 'son'].Name = "kurt"
intList[1.isOdd() ? 2 : 3] = 30
```

### New `#Script` Script Methods

- new `userAuthId` and `userAuthName` script methods (aliases for `userSession.UserAuthId` & `userSession.UserAuthName`)
- new `utcNowOffset` for `DateTimeOffset.UtcNow` and `nguid` for `Guid.NewGuid()`
- new `envCommandLineArgs` for `Environment.GetCommandLineArgs()`
- new `it.ownProps` in Partials to only return user-defined arguments passed to it (e.g. not implicit `it` bindings)
- new `requestBodyAsJson` as deserialized JSON Object or `requestBodyAsString` raw string Request Body
- new `toCoercedDictionary` converts String Dictionary to Object Dictionary with values coerced following JS behavior 
- new `typeofProgId` on Windows for `Type.GetTypeFromProgID(name)`
- new `svgAdd` and `svgAddFile` to register SVGs
- new `resolveArg` (local var resolution), `resolveGlobal` (PageResult.Args), `resolveContextArg` (Context.Args) APIs

The `resolve*` APIs let you resolve a variable named with the result of an expression, e.g:

```js
var tableNames = resolveGlobal(`${db}_tables`)
```

Which is the same as:

```js
var tableNames = global[`${db}_tables`]
```

Whereas `resolveArg` lets you resolve a variable using locally scope resolution hierarchy:

```js
var tableNames = resolveArg(`${db}_tables`)
```

If `db` was **northwind** this would be the same as:

```js
var tableNames = northwind_tables
```

#### Other features

::: v-pre
- Can now use `$` in variable identifiers
- Can use top-level `{{ 'ex' |> catchError }}` at start of Page to capture exceptions in `ex` & continue page execution
:::

### Modified `if*` methods behavior

The `if*` APIs have changed behavior to stop execution instead of returning `null` which previously allowed fallback to 
an `otherwise` script method, e.g:

```js
'Is Authenticated' |> if(auth) |> otherwise('Not Authenticated')
```

This is more naturally expressed using a ternary expression:

```js
auth ? 'Is Authenticated' : 'Not Authenticated'
```

Alternatively you can use the wordier `*Else` script methods or `iif` to return a default value:

```js
'Is Authenticated' |> ifElse(auth, 'Not Authenticated')
'Is Authenticated' |> unlessElse(!auth, 'Not Authenticated')

iif(auth,'Is Authenticated','Not Authenticated')
```

The new behavior is changed so that `useDb` only gets called if `db` is "truthy":

```js
{namedConnection:db} |> if(db) |> useDb
```

### init.ss Startup Scripts

ServiceStack Apps that have `SharpPagesFeature` configured can also use `init.ss` (in addition to previous `init.html`) for declaring
one-time Startup logic in `#Script` (akin to `Startup.cs` for C#).

[_init.ss](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/SharpData/blob/master/wwwroot/_init.ss) is used in Script Pages Apps like 
[SharpData](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/SharpData) to construct a ServiceStack App's [SVG stylesheet bundle](/svg) from a user-defined 
list of embedded `*.svg` resources and inline SVG declarations, e.g:

::: v-pre
```hbs
{{ 
    var AppSvgs = {
        'action/home.svg':                    'home',
        'device/storage.svg':                 'db',
        'action/list.svg':                    'table',
        'navigation/first_page.svg':          'chevron-first',
        'navigation/last_page.svg':           'chevron-last',
        'navigation/expand_more.svg':         'chevron-down',
        'navigation/chevron_left.svg':        'chevron-left',
        'navigation/chevron_right.svg':       'chevron-right',
        'navigation/expand_less.svg':         'chevron-up',
        'content/clear.svg':                  'clear',
        'content/filter_list.svg':            'filter',
    }

### Lisp

Support for [dorun](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/dorun) was added for executing a "statement block" (sequence of expressions) 
with side-effects that you want to discard the return type (akin to `void` return type):

```csharp
context.EvaluateLisp("(dorun println (map fizzbuzz (range 1 100)))");
```

Or you can use `do` to return the last expression in the statement block:

```csharp
context.EvaluateLisp("(return (do (+ 1 1) (+ 2 2)) )") //= 4
context.EvaluateLisp("(return (do (+ 1 1) (+ 2 2) nil)) )") //= null
context.EvaluateLisp("(return (do ()) )") //= null
```

## ServiceStack

### Embedded UMD build of `@servicestack/client`

A UMD version of the [@servicestack/client](https://github.com/ServiceStack/servicestack-client) JavaScript client library 
that contains the [TypeScript Service and SSE Clients](/typescript-add-servicestack-reference) is now embedded in **ServiceStack.dll**.
It's the modern, dependency-free replacement to [ss-utils.js](/ss-utils-js) which requires jQuery which is used instead in all
SPA Project Templates.

The embedded UMD version allows for the creation of stand-alone pages that accesses your ServiceStack JSON APIs 
without any external file references with the single `<script/>` reference:

```html
<script src="/js/servicestack-client.js"></script>
```

This is used by the updated [mix init](/mix-tool#mix-usage) gists when generating its empty Web Apps:

    $ mkdir web && cd web
    $ x mix init
    $ dotnet run

Where its dep-free [/index.html](https://gist.github.com/gistlyn/58030e271595520d87873c5df5e4c2eb#file-wwwroot-index-html) use its
`JsonServiceClient` to call its **/hello** API:

![](/img/pages/release-notes/v5.9/init.png)

To call APIs you'll need to include the JS transpiled DTOs of your Services [TypeScript DTOs](/typescript-add-servicestack-reference):

```html
<script src="/js/servicestack-client.js"></script>
<script>
    Object.assign(window, window['@servicestack/client']); //import into global namespace

    // generate typed dtos with /typescript-add-servicestack-reference
    var Hello = /** @class */ (function () {
        function Hello(init) { Object.assign(this, init); }
        Hello.prototype.createResponse = function () { return new HelloResponse(); };
        Hello.prototype.getTypeName = function () { return 'Hello'; };
        return Hello;
    }());
    var HelloResponse = /** @class */ (function () {
        function HelloResponse(init) { Object.assign(this, init); }
        return HelloResponse;
    }());

    var client = new JsonServiceClient();
    client.get(new Hello({ name: val }))
        .then(function(r) {
            document.getElementById('result').innerHTML = r.result;
        });
</script>
```

Although modern browsers (as well as any TypeScript or Webpack project) let you use the much nicer async/await syntax:

```js
let r = await client.get(new Hello({ name: val }))
```

### TypeScript Nullable properties

The default TypeScript generated for a C# DTO like:

```csharp
public class Data
{
    [Required]
    public int Value { get; set; }
    public int? OptionalValue { get; set; }
    public string Text { get; set; }
}
```

Will render the DTO with optional properties like:

```csharp
export class Data
{
    // @Required()
    public value: number;

    public optionalValue?: number;
    public text?: string;

    public constructor(init?: Partial<Data>) { (Object as any).assign(this, init); }
}
```

You can change the behavior to emit nullable properties instead with:

```csharp
TypeScriptGenerator.UseNullableProperties = true;
```

Where it will instead emit nullable properties:

```ts
export class Data
{
    public value: number|null;
    public optionalValue: number|null;
    public text: string|null;

    public constructor(init?: Partial<Data>) { (Object as any).assign(this, init); }
}
```

Should you need finer-grained customization and want to control which type and property should be nullable you can 
use the new customizable filters (which `UseNullableProperties` defaults to):

```csharp
TypeScriptGenerator.IsPropertyOptional = (generator, type, prop) => false;

TypeScriptGenerator.PropertyTypeFilter = (gen, type, prop) => 
    gen.GetPropertyType(prop, out var isNullable) + "|null";
```

### Embedded Login Page fallback

The `AuthFeature` adds a fallback **/login.html** page if the `HtmlRedirect` remains the default and no `/login.html` exists, otherwise
if using a custom `/login` page in either **Razor** or **Script Pages** they'll continue to be used instead.

The default `/login.html` page provides an auto Login page that supports authentication via Credentials as well as a generating a dynamic 
list of OAuth providers, e.g the **NorthwindCrud** `/login` page with Facebook OAuth looks like:

![](/img/pages/release-notes/v5.9/auth-login.png)

If however you're using an SPA App with client side routing to implement `/login`, the default login page can be disabled with:

```csharp
new AuthFeature {
    IncludeDefaultLogin = false
}
```

### Lightweight Customizable HTML Templates

There's a new lightweight templating solution that can be used to override ServiceStack's [auto HTML Service response pages](/html5reportformat) 
at specific routes, e.g. this is used to complete the auth/login flow in default apps which is pre-configured with:

 ```csharp
GetPlugin<HtmlFormat>.PathTemplates["/auth"] = "/Templates/Auth.html";
```

Specifying the **/path/info**  to override and the **VirtualPath** of the static HTML page that should be returned instead.

That instead of the JSON HTML Dump of the `/auth` endpoint, now returns a static `.html` page to display the `AuthenticateResponse`
DTO in a custom beautified HTML view:

![](/img/pages/release-notes/v5.9/auth-page.png)

The static HTML templates will replace these variable placeholders which will allow you to render a custom view of service responses:

 - `${Dto}` JSON Response DTO
 - `${BaseUrl}` - `IRequest.GetBaseUrl()`
 - `${ServiceUrl}` - Service URL

### Hosting ASP.NET Core Apps on Custom Path

The new `PathBase` property on AppHost is now the official API for hosting a ServiceStack .NET Core App at a custom path which can be
specified at initialization:

```csharp
app.UseServiceStack(new AppHost {
    PathBase = "/api",
    AppSettings = new NetCoreAppSettings(Configuration)
});
```

Resulting in both `Config.PathBase` and `Config.HandlerFactoryPath` getting populated with and without the `/` suffix:

```csharp
Config.PathBase           //= /api
Config.HandlerFactoryPath //= api
```

When necessary the `PathBase` property is available in both server rendered views:

::: v-pre
  - `{{PathBase}}` variable in [#Script Pages](https://sharpscript.net/docs/script-pages)
  - `PathBase` in Razor Views
:::

### Pluralize and Singularize

In order to use optimal user-friendly routes in our AutoGenerated AutoQuery Services, an interned version of 
[Andrew Peters port of Rails Inflector](http://andrewpeters.net/inflectornet/) is available under the `Words` static class
should you need to `Pluralize` or `Singularize` text:

```csharp
var plural = Words.Pluralize("Customer");      //= Customers
var singular = Words.Singularize("Customers"); //= Customer
```

### AuthSecret Admin Session

Super User Requests using [Config.AdminAuthSecret](/debugging#authsecret) now return an Authenticated Admin UserSession 
whose default values can be modified at `AuthFeature.AuthSecretSession`:

 - `DisplayName`: Admin
 - `UserName`: authsecret
 - `AuthProvider`: authsecret
 - `Roles`: Admin
 - `UserAuthId`: 0

### Exception Handling

`Config.ReturnsInnerException` now defaults to `false` in .NET Core. Returning the InnerException was an attempt to return
the most useful Exception but was often undesired. Instead when in `DebugMode` the populated StackTrace will return
the StackTraces of all Inner Exceptions, the added detail making it better to be able to identify the source of the Exception when 
by inspecting the Error Response.

### GatewayExceptionHandlers

The new Gateway Exception Handlers provide the same Exception Handling callbacks as ServiceExceptions which you can use
to intercept Exceptions from Gateway requests:

```csharp
IAppHost.GatewayExceptionHandlers
IAppHost.GatewayExceptionHandlersAsync 
```

Gateway Exceptions can also be intercepted in your `AppHost` by overriding:

```csharp
public override async Task OnGatewayException(IRequest httpReq, object request, Exception ex) => ...
```

### System.Web Shims removed

To assist in being able to retain the same code-base in .NET Core and .NET Framework some core `System.Web.` classes 
were added like `IHttpHandler` which have now been moved to the `ServiceStack.Host` namespace. 

This can be a source breaking change if you have code that references these types, which can be resolved by including the namespace:

```csharp
using ServiceStack.Host;
```

### XmlSerializerFormat Plugin

The new `XmlSerializerFormat` plugin changes ServiceStack to serialize XML with .NET `XmlSerializer` instead of .NET XML 
`DataContractSerializer`:

```csharp
Plugins.Add(new XmlSerializerFormat());
```

The implementation provides a typical example of how to register or override different Content-Types in ServiceStack:

```csharp
public class XmlSerializerFormat : IPlugin
{
    public static void Serialize(IRequest req, object response, Stream stream)
    {
        var serializer = new XmlSerializer(response.GetType());
        serializer.Serialize(stream, response);
    }

    public static object Deserialize(Type type, Stream stream)
    {
        var serializer = new XmlSerializer(type.GetType());
        var obj = (Type) serializer.Deserialize(stream);
        return obj;
    }

    public void Register(IAppHost appHost)
    {
        appHost.ContentTypes.Register(MimeTypes.Xml, Serialize, Deserialize);
    }
}
```

### Cache Client

Most caching providers now provide an explicit API to remove expired entries:

```csharp
public interface ICacheClientExtended : ICacheClient
{
    void RemoveExpiredEntries();
}
```

The Memory Cache client periodically calls this every `MemoryCacheClient.CleaningInterval` (default 1000).

### Other features

- Fluent Validation upgraded to latest 9 Preview 2
- Support for returning naked `ReadOnlyMemory<char>` and `ReadOnlyMemory<byte>` raw text & binary in Service responses
- Support added for non-ascii UTF-8 chares in Content-Disposition file names
- ServiceStack's interned `RecyclableMemoryStream` updated to use latest [Microsoft.IO.RecyclableMemoryStream](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft.IO.RecyclableMemoryStream)

### Server Sent Events

[Server Events](/server-events) is more resilient and better detects and handles hung blocking async requests in ASP.NET Framework.

All Notify APIs now have overloads for being able to send raw JSON:

```csharp
public interface IServerEvents : IDisposable
{
    Task NotifyAllJsonAsync(string selector, string json, CancellationToken ct);
    Task NotifyChannelJsonAsync(string channel, string selector, string json, CancellationToken ct);
    Task NotifySubscriptionJsonAsync(string subscriptionId, string selector, string json, string channel=null, CancellationToken ct);
    Task NotifyUserIdJsonAsync(string userId, string selector, string json, string channel=null, CancellationToken ct);
    Task NotifyUserNameJsonAsync(string userName, string selector, string json, string channel=null, CancellationToken ct);
    Task NotifySessionJsonAsync(string sessionId, string selector, string json, string channel=null, CancellationToken ct);
}
```

Update Events for when a subscription updates their registered channels are now sent to new & previously subscribed channels.
`IEventSubscription` captures both old & new channels in `MergedChannels` collection whilst the `Channels` return the currently
subscribed channels so the difference between `MergedChannels-Channels` determines which channels were unsubscribed to.

### Stand-alone Razor Views

Support for rendering stand-alone HTML Views from Razor Pages has been added to .NET Core's [ServiceStack.Razor implementation](/netcore-razor)
which can use the `GetViewPage()` API for retrieving View Pages (e.g. under `~/Views`) and the `GetContentPage()` API for retrieving 
Content Pages (e.g. under `/wwwroot`). 

You can then use `RenderToHtmlAsync()` API to render the HTML output in a UTF-8 `ReadOnlyMemory<char>` which your Services can return directly 
for optimal efficiency, or if needed the rendered output can be converted to a `string` with `.ToString()`:

```csharp
public async Task<object> Any(MyRequest request)
{
    var razor = GetPlugin<RazorFormat>();
    var view = razor.GetViewPage("MyView");
    if (view == null)
        throw HttpError.NotFound("Razor view not found: " + "MyView");

    var ret = await razor.RenderToHtmlAsync(view, new MyModel { Name = "World" },
        layout:"_MyLayout"); //if Layout specified in `.cshtml` page it uses that
    return ret;
}
```

For even better efficiency the Razor View can render to the Response `OutputStream` directly with `WriteHtmlAsync()` to write the rendered UTF-8 bytes 
directly to the `OutputStream` instead of above where it converts it into a UTF-8 string before converting it back to UTF-8 bytes when ServiceStack
writes it to the response:

```csharp
public async Task Any(MyRequest request)
{
    var razor = GetPlugin<RazorFormat>();
    var view = razor.GetViewPage("MyView");
    if (view == null)
        throw HttpError.NotFound("Razor view not found: " + "MyView");

    await razor.WriteHtmlAsync(Response.OutputStream, view, 
        new MyModel { Name = "World" }, 
        layout:"_MyLayout"); //if Layout specified in `.cshtml` page it uses that
}
```

If needed you can also render the view with an anonymous Model Type, e.g:

```csharp
await razor.RenderToHtmlAsync(view, new { Name = "World" });
```

Where the Razor View would need to specify it's using a `dynamic` model with:

```html
@model dynamic
```

### OpenApi 

To improve the metadata available when customizing the Open API output using [Operation Filters](/openapi#operation-filters), 
non-serializable `PropertyInfo` and `PropertyType` members have been added to the `OpenApiProperty` DTO they represent:

```csharp
public class OpenApiProperty
{
    [IgnoreDataMember]
    public PropertyInfo PropertyInfo { get; set; }
    [IgnoreDataMember]
    public Type PropertyType { get; set; }
}
```

## OrmLite

OrmLite continues to evolve with new features gained in every release in response to Customer Feedback and when necessary 
to provide seamless optimal integrations into new Technologies like AutoCrud.

### Ensure

The new `Ensure()` API on OrmLite's typed `SqlExpression<T>` can be used to ensure that a condition is always applied irrespective
of other conditions, e.g:

#### Typed API

```csharp
var q = db.From<Rockstar>();
q.Ensure(x => x.Id == 1); //always applied

//...
q.Where(x => x.Age == 27);
q.Or(x => x.LivingStatus == LivingStatus.Dead);

var rows = db.Select(q);
```

#### Custom Parameterized SQL Expression

Custom SQL Ensure parameterized expressions:

```csharp
 q.Ensure("Id = {0}", 1); 
```

#### Multiple Ensure expressions

```csharp
var q = db
    .From<Rockstar>()
    .Join<RockstarAlbum>((r,a) => r.Id == a.RockstarId);

q.Ensure<Rockstar,RockstarAlbum>((r,a) => a.Name == "Nevermind" && r.Id == a.RockstarId);

q.Where(x => x.Age == 27)
 .Or(x => x.LivingStatus == LivingStatus.Dead);

q.Ensure(x => x.Id == 3);

var rows = db.Select(q);
```

These APIs are useful for mandatory filters like "Soft Deletes" and Multitenant records.

### Dictionary APIs

The new Dictionary APIs allow you to customize which parts of a Data Model should be modified by 
converting it into then manipulating an Object Dictionary, e.g:

#### Insert by Dictionary

```csharp
var row = new Person { FirstName = "John", LastName = "Smith" };
Dictionary<string,object> obj = row.ToObjectDictionary();
obj[nameof(Person.LastName)] = null;

row.Id = (int) db.Insert<Person>(obj, selectIdentity:true);
```

#### Update by Dictionary

```csharp
Person row = db.SingleById<Person>(row.Id);
var obj = row.ToObjectDictionary();
obj[nameof(Person.LastName)] = "Smith";
db.Update<Person>(obj);
```

#### UpdateOnly by Dictionary

```csharp
// By Primary Key Id
var fields = new Dictionary<string, object> {
    [nameof(Person.Id)] = 1,
    [nameof(Person.FirstName)] = "John",
    [nameof(Person.LastName)] = null,
};

db.UpdateOnly<Person>(fields);

// By Custom Where Expression
var fields = new Dictionary<string, object> {
    [nameof(Person.FirstName)] = "John",
    [nameof(Person.LastName)] = null,
};

db.UpdateOnly<Person>(fields, p => p.LastName == "Hendrix");
```

#### Delete by Dictionary

```csharp
db.Delete<Rockstar>(new Dictionary<string, object> {
    ["Age"] = 27
});
```

### Custom Insert and Update Expressions

The new `[CustomInsert]` and `[CustomUpdate]` attributes can be used to override what values rows are inserted
during INSERT's and UPDATE's. 

We can use this to insert a salted and hashed password using PostgreSQL native functions:

```csharp
public class CustomSqlUser
{
    [AutoIncrement]
    public int Id { get; set; }

    public string Email { get; set; }

    [CustomInsert("crypt({0}, gen_salt('bf'))"),
     CustomUpdate("crypt({0}, gen_salt('bf'))")]
    public string Password { get; set; }
}

var user = new CustomSqlUser {
    Email = "user@email.com", 
    Password = "secret"
};
db.Insert(user);
```

We can then use `Sql.Custom()` to create a partially typed custom query to match on the hashed password, e.g:

```csharp
var quotedSecret = db.Dialect().GetQuotedValue("secret");
var q = db.From<CustomSqlUser>()
    .Where(x => x.Password == Sql.Custom($"crypt({quotedSecret}, password)"));
var row = db.Single(q);
```

### DbScripts

The New DB Scripts below surfaces existing OrmLite helpers to assist in generation of SQL queries in `#Script`:

 - `sqlCast` - RDBMS specific CAST expression
 - `sqlOrderByFields` - Quoted multi order by fields
 - `sqlVerifyFragment` - Verify SQL fragment

The `dbCount` API returns the number of rows the specified query returns whilst `dbExists` returns a `bool` 
if the specified query returns any rows:

```js
sql |> dbCount(args)

sql |> dbExists(args)
```

### DbScriptsAsync sync APIs

In future we recommend only using `DbScriptsAsync` going forward as it's often useful to be explicit when using async and sync queries.
To facilitate this all `DbScripts` sync APIs have been merged into `DbScriptsAsync` and given `*Sync` suffixes:

```csharp
Plugins.Add(new SharpPagesFeature {
    ScriptMethods = { new DbScriptsAsync() }
});
```

The `*Sync` APIs are useful when the actual resolved value is needed, like in logical binary expression or a `[ValidateRequest]`
Condition which expects a "truthy" result:

```csharp
[ValidateRequest(Condition = "dCountSync('SELECT * FROM RockstarAlbum WHERE RockstarId = @Id', { dto.Id }) == 0", 
                 ErrorCode = "HasForeignKeyReferences")]
public class MyRequest { ... }
```

```csharp
[ValidateRequest(Condition = "!dbExistsSync('SELECT * FROM RockstarAlbum WHERE RockstarId = @Id', { dto.Id })", 
                 ErrorCode = "HasForeignKeyReferences")]
public class MyRequest { ... }
```

### Spread Util

The `SqlSpread()` API is useful to generate an escaped list of parameterized values for use in SQL `IN()` statements and SQL functions:

```csharp
var dialect = db.Dialect();
dialect.SqlSpread(1, 2, 3);         //= 1,2,3
dialect.SqlSpread("A", "B", "C");   //= 'A','B','C'
dialect.SqlSpread("A'B", "C\"D");   //= 'A''B','C\"D'
```

### PostgreSQL Array

The `PgSql.Array()` provides a typed API for generating [PostgreSQL Array Expressions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/arrays.html), e.g:

```csharp
PgSql.Array(1,2,3)     //= ARRAY[1,2,3]
var strings = new[]{ "A","B","C" };
PgSql.Array(strings)   //= ARRAY['A','B','C']
```

Which you can safely use in Custom SQL Expressions that use PostgreSQL's native ARRAY support:

```csharp
q.And($"{PgSql.Array(anyTechnologyIds)} && technology_ids")
q.And($"{PgSql.Array(labelSlugs)} && labels");
```

If you want and empty collection to return `null` instead of an empty `ARRAY[]` you can use the `nullIfEmpty` overload:

```csharp
PgSql.Array(new string[0], nullIfEmpty:true)      //= null
PgSql.Array(new[]{"A","B","C"}, nullIfEmpty:true) //= ARRAY['A','B','C']
```

### PostgreSQL Params

The `PgSql.Param()` API provides a resolve the correct populated `NpgsqlParameter` and `NpgsqlDbType` from a C# Type
which can be used to query custom PostgreSQL Data Types in APIs that accept `IDbDataParameter` parameters, e.g:

```csharp
public class FunctionResult
{
    public int[] Val { get; set; }
}

var p = PgSql.Param("paramValue", testVal);
var sql = "SELECT * FROM my_func(@paramValue)";
var rows = db.Select<FunctionResult>(sql, new [] { p });
```
