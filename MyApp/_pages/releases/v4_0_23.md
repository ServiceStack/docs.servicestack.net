## [AutoQuery](/autoquery/)

The big ticket feature in this release is the new [AutoQuery](/autoquery/) feature - with our approach of enabling Queryable Data Services, that's designed to avoid [OData's anti-patterns and pitfalls](/autoquery#why-not-odata).

 - Simple, intuitive and easy to use!
 - Works with all OrmLite's [supported RDBMS providers](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.OrmLite/#download)
 - Supports multiple table JOINs and custom responses
 - Code-first, declarative programming model
 - Promotes clean, intent-based self-describing API's
 - Highly extensible, implementations are completely overridable
 - Configurable Adhoc, Explicit and Implicit conventions
 - Allows preemptive client queries
 - New `GetLazy()` API in Service Clients allow transparently streaming of paged queries
 - Raw SqlFilters available if required

#### AutoQuery Services are normal ServiceStack Services

AutoQuery also benefits from just being normal ServiceStack Services where you can re-use existing knowledge in implementing, customizing, introspecting and consuming ServiceStack services, i.e:

 - Utilizes the same customizable [Request Pipeline](/order-of-operations)
 - AutoQuery services can be mapped to any [user-defined route](/routing)
 - Is available in all [registered formats](/formats)
   - The [CSV Format](/csv-format) especially shines in AutoQuery who's tabular result-set are perfect for CSV
 - Can be [consumed from typed Service Clients](/clients-overview) allowing an end-to-end API without code-gen in [PCL client platforms as well](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/HelloMobile)

### Getting Started

AutoQuery uses your Services existing OrmLite DB registration, the example below registers an InMemory Sqlite Provider:

```csharp
container.Register<IDbConnectionFactory>(
    new OrmLiteConnectionFactory(":memory:", SqliteDialect.Provider));
```

There are no additional dependencies, enabling AutoQuery is as easy as registering the AutoQueryFeature Plugin:

```csharp
Plugins.Add(new AutoQueryFeature { MaxLimit = 100 });
```

The configuration above limits all queries to a maximum of **100** results.

The minimum code to expose a Query Service for the `Rockstar` table under a user-defined Route is just:

```csharp
[Route("/rockstars")]
public class FindRockstars : QueryBase<Rockstar> {}
```

With no additional code, this allows you to use any of the registered built-in conventions, e.g:

    /rockstars?Ids=1,2,3
    /rockstars?AgeOlderThan=42
    /rockstars?AgeGreaterThanOrEqualTo=42
    /rockstars?FirstNameIn=Jim,Kurt
    /rockstars?FirstNameBetween=A,F
    /rockstars?FirstNameStartsWith=Jim
    /rockstars?LastNameEndsWith=son
    /rockstars?IdAbove=1000

You're also able to formalize your API by adding concrete properties to your Request DTO:

```csharp
public class QueryRockstars : QueryBase<Rockstar>
{
    public int? AgeOlderThan { get; set; }
}
```

Which now lets you access AutoQuery Services from the ServiceStack's [Typed Service Clients](/csharp-client):

```csharp
client.Get(new QueryRockstars { AgeOlderThan = 42 });
```

You can also take advantage of the new `GetLazy()` API to transparently stream large result-sets in managable-sized chunks:

```csharp
var results = client.GetLazy(new QueryMovies { Ratings = new[]{"G","PG-13"}}).ToList();
```

As GetLazy returns a lazy `IEnumerable<T>` sequence it can be used within LINQ expressions:

```csharp
var top250 = client.GetLazy(new QueryMovies { Ratings = new[]{ "G", "PG-13" } })
    .Take(250)
    .ConvertTo(x => x.Title);
```

This is just a sampler, for a more complete guide to AutoQuery checkout the [AutoQuery wiki](/autoquery/).

## New VistaDB OrmLite Provider!

Also in this release is a preview release of OrmLite's new support for [VistaDB](http://www.gibraltarsoftware.com/) thanks to the efforts of [Ilya Lukyanov](https://github.com/ilyalukyanov).

[VistaDB](http://www.gibraltarsoftware.com/) is a commercial easy-to-deploy SQL Server-compatible embedded database for .NET that provides a good alternative to Sqlite for embedded scenarios.

To use first download and install [VistaDB](http://www.gibraltarsoftware.com/) itself, then grab OrmLite's VistaDB provider from NuGet:

    PM> Install-Package ServiceStack.OrmLite.VistaDb

Then register the VistaDB Provider and the filename of what embedded database to use with:

```csharp
VistaDbDialect.Provider.UseLibraryFromGac = true;

container.Register<IDbConnectionFactory>(
    new OrmLiteConnectionFactory("Data Source=db.vb5;", VistaDbDialect.Provider));
```

The VistaDB provider is almost a complete OrmLite provider, the one major missing feature is OrmLite's new support for [Optimistic Concurrency](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.OrmLite/#optimistic-concurrency) which is missing in VistaDB which doesn't support normal Database triggers but we're still researching the most optimal way to implement this in VistaDB.

## Improved AspNetWindowsAuthProvider

A new `LoadUserAuthFilter` was added to allow `AspNetWindowsAuthProvider` to retrieve more detailed information about Windows Authenticated users by using the .NET's ActiveDirectory services, e.g:

```csharp
public void LoadUserAuthInfo(AuthUserSession userSession, 
    IAuthTokens tokens, Dictionary<string, string> authInfo)
{
    if (userSession == null) return;
    using (PrincipalContext pc = new PrincipalContext(ContextType.Domain))
    {
        var user = UserPrincipal.FindByIdentity(pc, userSession.UserAuthName);
        tokens.DisplayName = user.DisplayName;
        tokens.Email = user.EmailAddress;
        tokens.FirstName = user.GivenName;
        tokens.LastName = user.Surname;
        tokens.FullName = (String.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(user.MiddleName))
            ? "{0} {1}".Fmt(user.GivenName, user.Surname)
            : "{0} {1} {2}".Fmt(user.GivenName, user.MiddleName, user.Surname);
        tokens.PhoneNumber = user.VoiceTelephoneNumber;
    }
}
```

Then to use the above custom filter register it in AspNetWindowsAuthProvider with:

```csharp
Plugins.Add(new AuthFeature(
    () => new CustomUserSession(),
    new IAuthProvider[] {
        new AspNetWindowsAuthProvider(this) {
            LoadUserAuthFilter = LoadUserAuthInfo
        }
    ));
```
