## OrmLite now supports Async!

Another [major feature request](http://servicestack.uservoice.com/forums/176786-feature-requests/suggestions/6217167-provider-async-support-for-ormlite) 
is ticked off in this release with the new **Async support available in OrmLite!**

A quick overview of the new Async API's added can be seen in the class diagram below:

![OrmLite Async APIs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/Assets/master/img/ormlite/OrmLiteApiAsync.png) 

Basically most of OrmLite public API's now have async equivalents of the same name and an additional conventional `*Async` suffix. 
The Async API's also take an optional `CancellationToken` making converting sync code trivial, where you just need to
add the `Async` suffix and **await** keyword, as can be seen in the 
[Customer Orders UseCase upgrade to Async diff](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.OrmLite/commit/c1ce6f0eac99133fc232b263c26c42379d4c5f48)
, e.g:

Sync:

```csharp
db.Insert(new Employee { Id = 1, Name = "Employee 1" });
db.Save(product1, product2);
var customer = db.Single<Customer>(new { customer.Email }); 
```

Async:

```csharp
await db.InsertAsync(new Employee { Id = 1, Name = "Employee 1" });
await db.SaveAsync(product1, product2);
var customer = await db.SingleAsync<Customer>(new { customer.Email });
```

> Effectively the only Data Access API's that doesn't have async equivalents are `*Lazy` APIs yielding a lazy 
> sequence (incompatible with async) as well as **Schema** DDL API's which are typically not used at runtime.

For a quick preview of many of the new Async API's in action, checkout 
[ApiSqlServerTestsAsync.cs](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/main/ServiceStack.OrmLite/tests/ServiceStack.OrmLiteV45.Tests/ApiSqlServerTestsAsync.cs).

### Async RDBMS Providers

Currently only a limited number of RDBMS providers offer async API's which are only available in their **.NET 4.5** builds, which at this time are only:

  - [SQL Server .NET 4.5+](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ServiceStack.OrmLite.SqlServer)
  - [MySQL .NET 4.5+](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ServiceStack.OrmLite.MySql)

We've also added a 
[.NET 4.5 build for Sqlite](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ServiceStack.OrmLite.Sqlite.Mono) 
as it's a common use-case to swapout to use Sqlite's in-memory provider for faster tests. 
But as Sqlite doesn't provide async API's under-the-hood we fallback to *pseudo async* support where we just wrap its synchronous responses in `Task` results. 

Regardless of whether the RDBMS provider offers Async API's, you still can use the same OrmLite async API's with all providers,
where the same Async OrmLite API's can also be used in DB Providers that doesn't natively support Async (i.e. Sqlite):

 - [ApiSqlServerTestsAsync.cs](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/main/ServiceStack.OrmLite/tests/ServiceStack.OrmLiteV45.Tests/ApiSqlServerTestsAsync.cs)
 - [ApiMySqlTestsAsync.cs](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/main/ServiceStack.OrmLite/tests/ServiceStack.OrmLiteV45.Tests/ApiMySqlTestsAsync.cs)
 - [ApiSqliteTestsAsync.cs](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/main/ServiceStack.OrmLite/tests/ServiceStack.OrmLiteV45.Tests/ApiSqliteTestsAsync.cs)

Only when these Async API's are run on an RDBMS provider with native async support (i.e. .NET 4.5 SqlServer or MySql) will you benefit from true 
non-blocking Async I/O, otherwise it fallsback to *pseudo async* support, i.e. synchronous I/O datasets wrapped in `Task` Results.

### Multiple Self References

OrmLite's [POCO Reference conventions](/ormlite/typed-joins#reference-conventions) 
has been expanded to include support for multiple Self References. 

The example below shows a customer with multiple `CustomerAddress` references which are able to be matched with 
the `{PropertyReference}Id` naming convention, e.g:

```csharp
public class Customer
{
    [AutoIncrement]
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }

    [References(typeof(CustomerAddress))]
    public int? HomeAddressId { get; set; }

    [References(typeof(CustomerAddress))]
    public int? WorkAddressId { get; set; }

    [Reference]
    public CustomerAddress HomeAddress { get; set; }

    [Reference]
    public CustomerAddress WorkAddress { get; set; }
}
```

Once defined, it can be saved and loaded via OrmLite's normal Reference and Select API's, e.g:

```csharp
var customer = new Customer
{
    Name = "Z Customer",
    HomeAddress = new CustomerAddress {
        Address = "1 Home Street",
        Country = "US"
    },
    WorkAddress = new CustomerAddress {
        Address = "2 Work Road",
        Country = "UK"
    },
};

db.Save(customer, references:true);

var c = db.LoadSelect<Customer>(q => q.Name == "Z Customer");
c.WorkAddress.Address.Print(); // 2 Work Road

var ukAddress = db.Single<CustomerAddress>(q => q.Country == "UK");
ukAddress.Address.Print();     // 2 Work Road
```

## [ServiceStack.Redis SSL Support](/ssl-redis-azure)

The [most requested feature for ServiceStack.Redis](http://servicestack.uservoice.com/forums/176786-feature-requests/suggestions/6093693-support-ssl-connection-to-redis-instances-hosted-a) 
has also been realized in this release with **ServiceStack.Redis** now supporting **SSL connections** making it suitable for accessing 
remote Redis server instances over a **secure SSL connection**.

![Azure Redis Cache](https://github.com/ServiceStack/Assets/raw/master/img/wikis/redis/azure-redis-instance.png)

### Redis Use Cases

Redis is normally used as a back-end datastore whose access is typically limited to Internal networks or authorized networks protected via firewalls. 
The new SSL Support in the Redis Client also enables secure access to a redis-server instance over the Internet and public networks as well, 
a scenario that's been recently popularized by Cloud hosting environments like Azure Redis Cache.

### [Connecting to Azure Redis](/ssl-redis-azure)

As connecting to [Azure Redis Cache](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cache/) via SSL was the primary use-case for this feature, 
we've added a new 
[Getting connected to Azure Redis via SSL](/ssl-redis-azure)
to help you get started.

### Redis Connection Strings

Redis Connection strings have been expanded to support the more versatile URI format which is now able to capture most of Redis Client settings in a 
single connection string (akin to DB Connection strings).

Redis Connection Strings supports multiple URI-like formats, from a simple **hostname** or **IP Address and port** pair to a fully-qualified **URL** 
with multiple options specified on the QueryString. 

Some examples of supported formats:

    localhost
    127.0.0.1:6379
    redis://localhost:6379
    password@localhost:6379
    clientid:password@localhost:6379
    redis://clientid:password@localhost:6380?ssl=true&db=1

> More examples can be seen in 
[ConfigTests.cs](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Redis/blob/master/tests/ServiceStack.Redis.Tests/ConfigTests.cs)

Any additional configuration can be specified as QueryString parameters. The full list of options that can be specified include:

<table class="table">
    <tr>
        <td><b>Ssl</b></td>
        <td>bool</td>
        <td>If this is an SSL connection</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Db</b></td>
        <td>int</td>
        <td>The Redis DB this connection should be set to</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Client</b></td>
        <td>string</td>
        <td>A text alias to specify for this connection for analytic purposes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Password</b></td>
        <td>string</td>
        <td>UrlEncoded version of the Password for this connection</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>ConnectTimeout</b></td>
        <td>int</td>
        <td>Timeout in ms for making a TCP Socket connection</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>SendTimeout</b></td>
        <td>int</td>
        <td>Timeout in ms for making a synchronous TCP Socket Send</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>ReceiveTimeout</b></td>
        <td>int</td>
        <td>Timeout in ms for waiting for a synchronous TCP Socket Receive</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>IdleTimeOutSecs</b></td>
        <td>int</td>
        <td>Timeout in Seconds for an Idle connection to be considered active</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>NamespacePrefix</b></td>
        <td>string</td>
        <td>Use a custom prefix for ServiceStack.Redis internal index colletions</td>
    </tr>
</table>

### New `RedisManagerPool` Client Manager

With the introduction of Redis URI Connection Strings we've been able to simplify and streamline the existing `PooledRedisClientManager` 
implementation that's been extracted out into clients manager called `RedisManagerPool`. 
In addition to removing all above options on the Client Manager itself, we've also removed readonly connection strings so the configuration is 
much simpler and more aligned with the common use-case.

In most cases, `PooledRedisClientManager` is substitutable with `RedisManagerPool` e.g:

```csharp
container.Register<IRedisClientsManager>(c => 
    new RedisManagerPool(redisConnectionString));
```

### New Generic API's for calling Custom Redis commands

Most of the time when waiting to use a new [Redis Command](http://redis.io/commands) you'll need to wait for an updated version of 
**ServiceStack.Redis** to add support for the new commands likewise there are times when the Redis Client doesn't offer every permutation 
that redis-server supports. 

With the new `Custom` and `RawCommand` API's on `IRedisClient` and `IRedisNativeClient` you can now use the RedisClient to send your own 
custom commands that can call adhoc Redis commands:

```csharp
public interface IRedisClient
{
    ...
    RedisText Custom(params object[] cmdWithArgs);
}

public interface IRedisNativeClient
{
    ...
    RedisData RawCommand(params object[] cmdWithArgs);
    RedisData RawCommand(params byte[][] cmdWithBinaryArgs);
}
```

These API's return Custom Results in the generic data structures below:

```csharp
public class RedisText
{
    public string Text { get; set; }
    public List<RedisText> Children { get; set; }
}

public class RedisData
{
    public byte[] Data { get; set; }
    public List<RedisData> Children { get; set; } 
}
```

These Custom API's take a flexible `object[]` arguments which accepts any serializable value e.g. 
`byte[]`, `string`, `int` as well as any user-defined Complex Types which are transparently serialized 
as JSON and send across the wire as UTF-8 bytes. 

```csharp
var ret = Redis.Custom("SET", "foo", 1);          // ret.Text = "OK"

byte[] cmdSet = Commands.Set;
ret = Redis.Custom(cmdSet, "bar", "b");           // ret.Text = "OK"

ret = Redis.Custom("GET", "foo");                 // ret.Text = "1"
```

There are also 
[convenient extension methods](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Redis/blob/master/src/ServiceStack.Redis/RedisDataExtensions.cs) 
on `RedisData` and `RedisText` that make it easy to access structured data, e.g:

```csharp
var ret = Redis.Custom(Commands.Keys, "*");
var keys = ret.GetResults();                      // keys = ["foo", "bar"]

ret = Redis.Custom(Commands.MGet, "foo", "bar");
var values = ret.GetResults();                    // values = ["1", "b"]

Enum.GetNames(typeof(DayOfWeek)).ToList()
    .ForEach(x => Redis.Custom(Commands.RPush, "DaysOfWeek", x));
ret = Redis.Custom(Commands.LRange, "DaysOfWeek", 1, -2);
var weekDays = ret.GetResults();      

weekDays.PrintDump(); // ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday"]
```

and some more examples using Complex Types with the Custom API's:

```csharp
var ret = Redis.Custom(Commands.Set, "foo", new Poco { Name = "Bar" }); // ret.Text = "OK"

ret = Redis.Custom(Commands.Get, "foo");          // ret.Text =  {"Name":"Bar"}
Poco dto = ret.GetResult<Poco>();

dto.Name.Print(); // Bar
```

### New Config, Role and Client commands

A number of New API's added in this can be seen below:

```csharp
public interface IRedisClient
{
    ...
    RedisText GetServerRoleInfo();
    string GetConfig(string item);
    void SetConfig(string item, string value);
    void SaveConfig();
    void ResetInfoStats();

    string GetClient();
    void SetClient(string name);
    void KillClient(string address);
    long KillClients(string fromAddress = null, 
        string withId = null, RedisClientType? ofType = null, bool? skipMe = null);
    List<Dictionary<string, string>> GetClientsInfo();
    void PauseAllClients(TimeSpan duration);
}

public interface IRedisNativeClient
{
    ...
    void ConfigRewrite();
    RedisText Role();
    string ClientGetName();
    void ClientSetName(string client);
    void ClientKill(string host);
    long ClientKill(string addr = null, string id = null, string type = null, string skipMe = null);
    byte[] ClientList();
    void ClientPause(int timeOutMs);    
}
```

## [New VB.NET Add ServiceStack Reference!](/vbnet-add-servicestack-reference)

This release also adds [Add ServiceStack Reference](/add-servicestack-reference)
support for the last remaining major .NET language with the new first-class support for 
[VB.NET Add ServiceStack Reference](/vbnet-add-servicestack-reference)!

This now allows any C#, F# or VB.NET client project to be able generate and end-to-end typed API for your services just by providing the 
url of your remote ServiceStack instance, directly from within VS.NET!

![Add ServiceStack Reference](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/Assets/master/img/apps/StackApis/add-service-ref-flow.png)

After clicking OK, the servers DTO's and **ServiceStack.Client** NuGet package are added to the project, providing an instant typed API: 

![Calling a ServiceStack Service from VB.NET](https://github.com/ServiceStack/Assets/raw/master/img/apps/StackApis/call-service-vb.png)

Thanks to the close semantics between the C# and VB.NET languages, we're able to add support for all C# 
[customization options in VB.NET](/vbnet-add-servicestack-reference#dto-customization-options) as well.

Much of the new VB.NET NativeTypes provider is thanks to the efforts of [@KevinHoward](https://github.com/KevinHoward).

### [Upgrade ServiceStackVS](/create-your-first-webservice)

To take advantage of VB.NET Add ServiceStack Reference feature, 
[Upgrade or Install ServiceStackVS](/create-your-first-webservice) VS.NET Extension.
If you already have **ServiceStackVS** installed, uninstall it first from `Tools -> Extensions and Updates... -> ServiceStackVS -> Uninstall`.

## Simplified UX for all languages

Our first iteration of **Add ServiceStack Reference** for C# used a **T4 Template** to make it easy for clients to view and modify all 
Customization options available and to be able to auto-generate the Server DTO's by modifying and saving (or re-running) the T4 template. 

As F# projects didn't support T4 Templates, when we added support for 
[F# Add ServiceStack Reference](/fsharp-add-servicestack-reference)
we had to skip the T4 template and add the server-generated DTO's source file directly to the project. 

By skipping the T4 Template we pleasantly discovered we ended up with a nicer, simplified and more user-friendly UX, with less moving parts for 
the default use case of generating client DTO's based on the 
[Default Server Configuration](/csharp-add-servicestack-reference#change-default-server-configuration).

### Improving Single Generated Source File Story

We've since decided to embrace and provide a better development experience around a single source file approach and use it consistently in all 
C#, F# and VB.NET projects - now resulting simpler **Add ServiceStack Reference** UX for all client projects.

### Update ServiceStack Reference Context Menu Item

With the latest **ServiceStackVS** you can now update the Server DTO's in all projects by clicking on `Update ServiceStack Reference` 
on the context-menu, e.g:

![Update ServiceStack Reference](https://github.com/ServiceStack/Assets/raw/master/img/servicestackvs/servicestack%20reference/updateref-vbnet.gif)

### Updating and Customizing Generated Types

To [customize the generated DTO's](/csharp-add-servicestack-reference#dto-customization-options)
on the client you can just uncomment the option you want to change directly in the **header comments** and hit save. 
**ServiceStackVS** automatically watches for any changes to the generated dto source files (i.e. ending with `.dtos.cs`) and will automatically 
send the uncommented options to the remote server referenced by the `BaseUrl` and replace the existing file with the updated DTOs instantly!

Taking the example below, once we uncomment the `MakePartial` option and save the file, **ServiceStackVS** automatically sends a new request 
to the remote ServiceStack instance, passing in the `?MakePartial=False` option when requesting updated DTO's:

```csharp
/* Options:
Date: 2014-10-21 00:44:24
Version: 1
BaseUrl: https://stackapis.netcore.io

MakePartial: False
//MakeVirtual: True
//MakeDataContractsExtensible: False
//AddReturnMarker: True
//AddDescriptionAsComments: True
//AddDataContractAttributes: False
//AddIndexesToDataMembers: False
//AddResponseStatus: False
//AddImplicitVersion: 
//InitializeCollections: True
//AddDefaultXmlNamespace: http://schemas.servicestack.net/types
*/
```

After saving you'll be able to notice the DTO's are updated instantly with the `Date: *` changing to reflect the current time and the new 
generated DTO's no longer containing `partial` classes.

### ServiceStack.Text

New `JsConfig<T>.OnDeserializing` and dynamic `ShouldSerialize(string field)` customization options were added to ServiceStack's JSON and JSV 
Text serializers by [@pavelsavara](https://twitter.com/pavelsavara). An example of these new customization options in action is visible below:

```csharp
[DataContract]
public class CustomSerializedPoco
{
    [IgnoreDataMember]
    public HashSet<string> hasAttribute;

    [DataMember(EmitDefaultValue = false, IsRequired = false)]
    public int A { get; set; }

    [DataMember(EmitDefaultValue = false, IsRequired = false)]
    public int? B { get; set; }

    public bool? ShouldSerialize(string fieldName)
    {
        return hasAttribute == null 
            ? null
            :  hasAttribute.Contains(fieldName);
    }

    public object OnDeserializing(string fieldName, object value)
    {
        if (hasAttribute == null)
            hasAttribute = new HashSet<string>();
        hasAttribute.Add(fieldName);
        return value;
    }
}
```

This change makes it possible to create dynamic POCO's that behave in a similar way that dynamic languages can, 
e.g. After deserialization you can detect which fields were deserialized by inspecting the `hasAttribute` collection.

The `ShouldSerialize` API, closely follows the existing `ShouldSerialize{X}` convention but instead allows for a single API 
to handle all serializable properties. 

The API returns a `bool?` which has the following meaning: 
 - `true` - Should be emitted  
 - `false` - Should not be emitted 
 - `null` - Use default behavior

This allows us to implement a custom type that can support full round-trip when the field on the original JSON payload allowing use to 
implement a custom type with similar functionality to `IExtensibleDataObject` which allows survival and forwarding of unknown properties, but for JSON.

## [RabbitMQ](/rabbit-mq)

RabbitMQ Server and Client now have optional `PublishMessageFilter` and `GetMessageFilter` callbacks which can be used to intercept
outgoing and incoming messages, the `IBasicProperties.Type` is also pre-populated with the Type name of the message body that was published, e.g:

```csharp
var mqServer = new RabbitMqServer("localhost") 
{
    PublishMessageFilter = (queueName, properties, msg) => {
        properties.AppId = "app:{0}".Fmt(queueName);
    },
    GetMessageFilter = (queueName, basicMsg) => {
        var props = basicMsg.BasicProperties;
        receivedMsgType = props.Type; //automatically added by RabbitMqProducer
        receivedMsgApp = props.AppId;
    }
};

using (var mqClient = mqServer.CreateMessageQueueClient())
{
    mqClient.Publish(new Hello { Name = "Bugs Bunny" });
}

receivedMsgApp.Print();   // app:mq:Hello.In
receivedMsgType.Print();  // Hello
```

## Other Minor Changes

 - ServerEvents Server now echoes heartbeat messages back through to the listening connection, 
   `ServerEventsClient` only fires the `OnHeartbeat` callback when it's receives the echoed `cmd.Heartbeat` command message
 -  Request binding for `Path` and `QueryString` variables are added to DTO's with Request DTO's providing their own [custom body deserialization](/serialization-deserialization) by implementing `IRequiresRequestStream`
 - New `IAppHost.OnDisposeCallbacks` available allowing **Plugins** to register callbacks when `AppHost` is disposed
 - `Config.UseHttpsLinks` now modifies generated BaseUrl of all links to use `https`
 - The `ResponseStatus` on Custom DTO's are now preserved when thrown inside a custom `HttpError` response
 - Equality members added to `[Route]`, `[Authenticate]`, `[RequiredRole]` and `[RequiredPermission]` attributes
 - `ToOptimizedResultUsingCache` no longer double-encodes raw `string` responses
 - `MvcHtmlString` was moved to `ServiceStack.Html` namespace
 - New `StaticFileHandler.ResponseFilter` added to be able to modify custom headers returned on static files
 - Many of OrmLite's static Extension method classes were renamed into a more logical grouping. 
   These changes are source compatible for typical usage of OrmLite API's, i.e. referenced as extension methods

## Breaking changes

### Added new .NET 4.5 Builds

In preparation for introducing Async API's we've added new **.NET 4.5 builds** for the following packages:

  - ServiceStack.OrmLite
  - ServiceStack.OrmLite.Sqlite.Mono
  - ServiceStack.OrmLite.SqlServer
  - ServiceStack.OrmLite.MySql
  - ServiceStack.Server

When adding ServiceStack NuGet Packages to a **.NET 4.5** project you will now get these newer .NET 4.5 builds instead.
The additional builds means you could potentially run into issues if mixing .NET v4.0 and v4.5 builds as all dependencies 
need to reference the same build version.

Should you need to, the easiest way to fix any versioning issues is to make sure all projects use the same .NET Framework version 
(e.g. .NET 4.5) and then just uninstall and re-install the ServiceStack NuGet packages.

### Removed ThreadStatic OrmLite Configuration

We've also removed our existing ThreadStatic config variables (used to temporarily override global configuration).
Most per-connection state is now stored on the connection e.g. `CommandTimeout` was previously overridden with:

```csharp
var hold = OrmLiteConfig.TSCommandTimeout;
try {
	OrmLiteConfig.TSCommandTimeout = 60;
	db.Select(...);
} finally {
	OrmLiteConfig.TSCommandTimeout = hold;
}
```

Is now set directly on the connection (and only applies to that connection), e.g:

```csharp
using (var db = DbFactory.Open())
{
	db.SetCommandTimeout(60);
	db.Select(...);
}
```

Likewise if you ever need to access the current `OrmLiteConfig.DialectProvider`, it should now be retrieved from the `IDbConnection`, i.e:

```csharp
db.GetDialectProvider();
``` 

and if you ever need to access the underlying ADO.NET `IDbConnection` or `IDbCommand` you can access them via the following APIs:

```csharp
IDbConnection adoDb = db.ToDbConnection();
IDbCommand adoDbCmd = dmCmd.ToDbCommand();
```

### IReturnVoid now returns void

All `IReturnVoid` API's on Service Clients have been changed to return `void` instead of 
`HttpWebResponse` which needed to be explicitly disposed by the callee. 

To access the `HttpWebResponse`, Request DTO's can be changed to `IReturn<HttpWebResponse>` 

```csharp
public class EmptyResponse : IReturn<HttpWebResponse> { ... }
```

Alternatively the Response can be specified on the call-site with:

```csharp
HttpWebResponse response = client.Get<HttpWebResponse>(new EmptyResponse());
```
