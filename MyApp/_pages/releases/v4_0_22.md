## OrmLite

This was primarily an OrmLite-focused release with the introduction of major new features:

### Typed SQL Expressions now support Joins!

Another [highly requested feature](http://servicestack.uservoice.com/forums/176786-feature-requests/suggestions/4459040-enhance-ormlite-with-common-data-usage-patterns) has been realized in this release with OrmLite's typed SqlExpressions extended to add support for Joins. 

The new JOIN support follows OrmLite's traditional approach of a providing a DRY, typed RDBMS-agnostic wrapper that retains a high affinity with SQL, providing an intuitive API that generates predictable SQL and a light-weight mapping to clean POCO's.

### Basic Example

Starting with the most basic example you can simply specify the table you want to join with:

```csharp
var dbCustomers = db.Select<Customer>(q => q.Join<CustomerAddress>());
```

This query rougly maps to the following SQL:

```sql
SELECT Customer.* 
  FROM Customer 
       INNER JOIN 
       CustomerAddress ON (Customer.Id == CustomerAddress.Id)
```

Just like before `q` is an instance of `SqlExpression<Customer>` which is bounded to the base `Customer` type (and what any subsequent implicit API's apply to). 

To better illustrate the above query, lets expand it to the equivalent explicit query:

```csharp
SqlExpression<Customer> q = db.From<Customer>();
q.Join<Customer,CustomerAddress>();

List<Customer> dbCustomers = db.Select(q);
```

### Reference Conventions

The above query joins together the `Customer` and `CustomerAddress` POCO's using the same relationship convention used in [OrmLite's support for References](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/main/ServiceStack.OrmLite/tests/ServiceStack.OrmLite.Tests/LoadReferencesTests.cs), i.e. using the referenced table `{ParentType}Id` property convention.

An example of what this looks like can be seen the POCO's below:

```csharp
class Customer {
    public Id { get; set; }
    ...
}
class CustomerAddress {
    public Id { get; set; }
    public CustomerId { get; set; }  // Reference based on Property name convention
}
```

References based on matching alias names is also supported, e.g:

```csharp
[Alias("LegacyCustomer")]
class Customer {
    public Id { get; set; }
    ...
}
class CustomerAddress {
    public Id { get; set; }

    [Alias("LegacyCustomerId")]             // Matches `LegacyCustomer` Alias
    public RenamedCustomerId { get; set; }  // Reference based on Alias Convention
}
```

Either convention lets you save a POCO and all its entity references with `db.Save()`, e.g:

```csharp
var customer =  new Customer {
    Name = "Customer 1",
    PrimaryAddress = new CustomerAddress {
        AddressLine1 = "1 Australia Street",
        Country = "Australia"
    },
};
db.Save(customer, references:true);
```

Going back to the above example: 

```csharp
q.Join<CustomerAddress>();
```

Uses the implicit join in the above reference convention to expand into the equivalent explicit API: 

```csharp
q.Join<Customer,CustomerAddress>((customer,address) => customer.Id == address.CustomerId);
```

### Selecting multiple columns across joined tables

Another behaviour implicit when selecting from a typed SqlExpression is that results are mapped to the `Customer` POCO. To change this default we just need to explicitly specify what POCO it should map to instead:

```csharp
List<FullCustomerInfo> customers = db.Select<FullCustomerInfo>(
    db.From<Customer>().Join<CustomerAddress>());
```

Where `FullCustomerInfo` is any POCO that contains a combination of properties matching any of the joined tables in the query. 

The above example is also equivalent to the shorthand `db.Select<Into,From>()` API:

```csharp
var customers = db.Select<FullCustomerInfo,Customer>(q => q.Join<CustomerAddress>());
```

Rules for how results are mapped is simply each property on `FullCustomerInfo` is mapped to the first matching property in any of the tables in the order they were added to the SqlExpression.

As most OrmLite tables have a primary key property named `Id`, the auto-mapping includes a fallback for mapping to a full namespaced Id property in the same `{Type}Id` format. This allows you to auto-populate `CustomerId`, `CustomerAddressId` and `OrderId` columns even though they aren't a match to any of the fields in any of the joined tables.

### Advanced Example

Seeing how the SqlExpression is constructed, joined and mapped, we can take a look at a more advanced example to showcase more of the new API's available:

```csharp
List<FullCustomerInfo> rows = db.Select<FullCustomerInfo>( // Map results to FullCustomerInfo POCO
  db.From<Customer>()                                      // Create typed Customer SqlExpression
    .LeftJoin<CustomerAddress>()                           // Implict left join with base table
    .Join<Customer, Order>((c,o) => c.Id == o.CustomerId)  // Explicit join and condition
    .Where(c => c.Name == "Customer 1")                    // Implicit condition on base table
    .And<Order>(o => o.Cost < 2)                           // Explicit condition on joined Table
    .Or<Customer,Order>((c,o) => c.Name == o.LineItem));   // Explicit condition with joined Tables
```

The comments next to each line document each Type of API used. Some of the new API's introduced in this example include:

  - Usage of `LeftJoin` for LEFT JOIN'S, `RightJoin` and `FullJoin` also available
  - Usage of `And<Table>()`, to specify a condition on a Joined table 
  - Usage of `Or<Table1,Table2>`, to specify a condition against 2 joined tables

More code examples of References and Joined tables are available in:

  - [LoadReferencesTests.cs](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/main/ServiceStack.OrmLite/tests/ServiceStack.OrmLite.Tests/LoadReferencesTests.cs)
  - [LoadReferencesJoinTests.cs](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/main/ServiceStack.OrmLite/tests/ServiceStack.OrmLite.Tests/LoadReferencesJoinTests.cs)

## Optimistic Concurrency

Another major feature added to OrmLite is support for optimistic concurrency which can be added to any table by adding a `ulong RowVersion { get; set; }` property, e.g:

```csharp
public class Poco
{
    ...
    public ulong RowVersion { get; set; }
}
```

RowVersion is implemented efficiently in all major RDBMS's, i.e:

 - Uses `rowversion` datatype in SqlServer 
 - Uses PostgreSql's `xmin` system column (no column on table required)
 - Uses UPDATE triggers on MySql, Sqlite and Oracle whose lifetime is attached to Create/Drop tables APIs

Despite their differing implementations each provider works the same way where the `RowVersion` property is populated when the record is selected and only updates the record if the RowVersion matches with what's in the database, e.g:

```csharp
var rowId = db.Insert(new Poco { Text = "Text" }, selectIdentity:true);

var row = db.SingleById<Poco>(rowId);
row.Text += " Updated";
db.Update(row); //success!

row.Text += "Attempting to update stale record";

//Can't update stale record
Assert.Throws<OptimisticConcurrencyException>(() =>
    db.Update(row));

//Can update latest version
var updatedRow = db.SingleById<Poco>(rowId);  // fresh version
updatedRow.Text += "Update Success!";
db.Update(updatedRow);

updatedRow = db.SingleById<Poco>(rowId);
db.Delete(updatedRow);                        // can delete fresh version
```

Optimistic concurrency is only verified on API's that update or delete an entire entity, i.e. it's not enforced in partial updates. There's also an Alternative API available for DELETE's:

```csharp
db.DeleteById<Poco>(id:updatedRow.Id, rowversion:updatedRow.RowVersion)
```

### Other OrmLite features

  - New [Limit API's added to JoinSqlBuilder](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/main/ServiceStack.OrmLite/tests/ServiceStack.OrmLite.Tests/Expression/SqlExpressionTests.cs#L126-L168)
  - SqlExpression's are now tied to the dialect provider at time of creation

## ServiceStack.Text

A new `JsConfig.ReuseStringBuffer` performance config option is available to JSON and JSV Text Serializers which lets you re-use ThreadStatic StringBuilder when serializing to a string. In initial benchmarks (both synchronous and parallel) it shows around a **~%30 increase in performance** for small POCO's. It can be enabled with:

```csharp
JsConfig.ReuseStringBuffer = true;
```

Default enum values can be excluded from being serialized with:

```csharp
JsConfig.IncludeDefaultEnums = false;
```

## ServiceStack

### [Messaging](/messaging)

Improved support for the MQ Request/Reply pattern with the new `GetTempQueueName()` API now available in all MQ Clients which returns a temporary queue (prefixed with `mq:tmp:`) suitable for use as the ReplyTo queue in Request/Reply scenarios:

```csharp
mqServer.RegisterHandler<Hello>(m =>
    new HelloResponse { Result = "Hello, {0}!".Fmt(m.GetBody().Name) });
mqServer.Start();

using (var mqClient = mqServer.CreateMessageQueueClient())
{
    var replyToMq = mqClient.GetTempQueueName();
    mqClient.Publish(new Message<Hello>(new Hello { Name = "World" }) {
        ReplyTo = replyToMq
    });

    IMessage<HelloResponse> responseMsg = mqClient.Get<HelloResponse>(replyToMq);
    mqClient.Ack(responseMsg);
    var responseDto = responseMsg.GetBody(); 
}
```

On [Rabbit MQ](/rabbit-mq) it creates an exclusive non-durable queue.

In [Redis MQ](/redis-mq) there's a new `RedisMqServer.ExpireTemporaryQueues()` API which can be used on StartUp to expire temporary queues after a given period.

Synchronous and Parallel tests for this feature is available in [MqRequestReplyTests.cs](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/tests/ServiceStack.Server.Tests/Messaging/MqRequestReplyTests.cs).
