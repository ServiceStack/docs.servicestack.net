</div></div>

Razor Press is a **Razor Pages** and **Markdown** powered alternative to Ruby's Jekyll & Vue's VitePress that's ideal for
generating fast, static content-centric & documentation websites. Inspired by [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev),
it's designed to effortlessly create documentation around content written in Markdown, rendered using C# Razor Pages
that's beautifully styled with [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com) and [@tailwindcss/typography](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin).

</div>

The resulting statically generated HTML pages can be easily deployed anywhere, where it can be hosted by any HTTP Server or CDN.
By default it includes GitHub Actions to deploy it your GitHub Repo's **gh-pages** branch where it's hosted for FREE
on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) CDN which can be easily configured to use your
[Custom Domain](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site).

### Install Razor Press

Download a new Razor Press Project with you preferred Project name below:

<razor-press></razor-press>

Alternatively you can install a new project template using the [x dotnet tool](https://docs.servicestack.net/dotnet-tool):

:::sh
x new razor-press ProjectName
:::

### Use Cases

Razor Press utilizes the same technology as
[Razor SSG](https://razor-ssg.web-templates.io/posts/razor-ssg) which is the template we recommend for developing any
statically generated sites with Razor like Blogs, Portfolios, and Marketing Sites as it includes more Razor & Markdown
features like blogs and integration with [Creator Kit](https://servicestack.net/creatorkit/) - a companion OSS project
offers the necessary tools any static website can use to reach and retain users, from managing subscriber mailing lists to
moderating a feature-rich comments system.

Some examples built with Razor SSG include:

<div class="not-prose mt-8 grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">

    </a>
</div>

### Documentation

Razor Press is instead optimized for creating documentation and content-centric websites, with built-in features useful
for documentation websites including:

- Customizable Sidebar Menus
- Document Maps
- Document Page Navigation
- Autolink Headers

#### Markdown Extensions

- Markdown Content Includes
- Tip, Info, Warning, Danger sections
- Copy and Shell command widgets

But given **Razor Press** and **Razor SSG** share the same implementation, their features are easily transferable, e.g.
The [What's New](/whatsnew) and [Videos](/videos) sections are
[features copied](https://razor-ssg.web-templates.io/posts/razor-ssg#whats-new-feature) from Razor SSG as they can be
useful in Documentation websites.

</div></div>

Following in the footsteps of [porting servicestack.net](https://servicestack.net/posts/new_razor_ssg_website) website
[from Jekyll](https://github.com/mythz/site) to
[Razor SSG](https://github.com/ServiceStack/servicestack.net), we've decided to
also take control over our last active VitePress website and port our [docs.servicestack.net](https://docs.servicestack.net) to
[Razor Press](https://razor-press.web-templates.io/), giving us complete control over its implementation allowing us to
resolve any issues and add any features ourselves as needed, at the same time freeing us from the complexity and brittleness
of the npm ecosystem with a more robust C# and Razor Pages SSG based implementation.

### VitePress Issues

Our 500 page [docs.servicestack.net](https://docs.servicestack.net) started experiencing growing pains under [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev)
which started experiencing rendering issues that we believe stems from VitePress's SSR/SPA hydration model that for
maximum performance would convert the initial downloaded SSR content into an SPA to speed up navigation between pages.

However several pages began to randomly show duplicate content and sometimes not display the bottom section of pages at all.
For a while we worked around these issues by running custom JavaScript to detect and remove duplicate content from the DOM
after the page loaded as well as moving bottom fragments of pages into separate includes and external Vue components
for the pages with missing content.

However as the time to detect and workaround these issues across all our documentation started becoming too time consuming,
it was time to consider a more permanent and effective solution.

### Porting to Razor SSG

Given we've already spent time & effort porting docs.servicestack.net
[from Jekyll to VitePress](https://servicestack.net/posts/jekyll-to-vitepress) less than 2 years ago and after the success
we had of rapidly [porting servicestack.net](https://servicestack.net/posts/new_razor_ssg_website) to 
[Razor SSG](https://razor-ssg.web-templates.io) and rapidly creating
[Vue Stable Diffusion](https://servicestack.net/posts/vue-stable-diffusion) with Razor SSG in a fraction of the time it
took to develop the equivalent [Blazor Diffusion](https://docs.servicestack.net/blazor-diffusion), it was clear we
should also do the same for the new documentation website.

Porting **docs.servicestack.net** ended up being fairly straightforward process that was completed in just a few days,
with most of the time spent on implementing existing VitePress features we used in C# and Markdig Extensions,
a new Responsive Tailwind Layout and adding support for Dark Mode which was previously never supported.

Fortunately none of VitePress's SSR/SPA hydration issues manifested in the port which adopted the
cleaner traditional architecture of generating clean HTML from Markdown and Razor Pages and enhanced on the client-side with Vue.

We're extremely happy with the result, a much lighter and cleaner HTML generated site that now supports Dark Mode!

<div class="not-prose mt-8 grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
    <a class="block group border dark:border-gray-800 hover:border-indigo-700 dark:hover:border-indigo-700" href="https://docs.servicestack.net?light">

</div>

### Razor Pages Benefits

The new Razor SSG implementation now benefits from Razor Pages flexible layouts and partials where pages can be optionally
implemented in just markdown, Razor or a hybrid mix of both. The [Vue](https://docs.servicestack.net/vue/?light) splash page is an example of this implemented in a custom
[/Vue/Index.cshtml](https://github.com/ServiceStack/docs.servicestack.net/blob/main/MyApp/Pages/Vue/Index.cshtml) Razor Page:

<div class="not-prose mt-8 grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
    <a class="block group border dark:border-gray-800 hover:border-indigo-700 dark:hover:border-indigo-700" href="https://docs.servicestack.net/vue/?light">
        <img class="p-2" src="https://servicestack.net/img/posts/razor-ssg/razor-pages-vue.png">
        <div class="bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 font-semibold group-hover:bg-indigo-700 group-hover:text-white text-center py-2">docs.servicestack.net</div>
    </a>
</div>

Other benefits include a new Documentation Map feature with live scroll updating, displayed on the right side of each documentation page.

## New in Razor SSG

We've continued improving the [Razor SSG](https://razor-ssg.web-templates.io) template for static generated websites
and Blogs.

### RSS Feed

Razor SSG websites now generates a valid RSS Feed for its blog to support their readers who'd prefer to read blog posts
with their favorite RSS reader:

<div class="not-prose my-8">
   <a href="https://razor-ssg.web-templates.io/feed.xml">
      <div class="block flex justify-center shadow hover:shadow-lg rounded overflow-hidden">
         <img class="max-w-3xl py-8" src="/img/pages/release-notes/v6.10/valid-rss.png">
      </div>
   </a>
   <div class="mt-4 flex justify-center">
      <a class="text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-800" href="https://razor-ssg.web-templates.io/feed.xml">https://razor-ssg.web-templates.io/feed.xml</a>
   </div>
</div>

### New Markdown Containers

All Razor Press's [Markdown Containers](https://razor-press.web-templates.io/containers) are also available in Razor SSG
websites for enabling rich, wrist-friendly consistent markup in your Markdown pages, e.g:

```md
::: info
This is an info box.
:::

::: tip
This is a tip.
:::

::: warning
This is a warning.
:::

::: danger
This is a dangerous warning.
:::

:::copy
Copy Me!
:::
```

::: info
This is an info box.
:::

::: tip
This is a tip.
:::

::: warning
This is a warning.
:::

::: danger
This is a dangerous warning.
:::

:::copy
Copy Me!
:::

See [Markdown Containers docs](https://razor-press.web-templates.io/containers) for more examples and how to 
implement your own [Custom Markdown containers](https://razor-press.web-templates.io/containers#implementing-block-containers).

### Support for Includes

Markdown fragments can be added to `_pages/_include` - a special folder rendered with
[Pages/Includes.cshtml](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/razor-ssg/blob/main/MyApp/Pages/Includes.cshtml) using
an [Empty Layout](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/razor-ssg/blob/main/MyApp/Pages/Shared/_LayoutEmpty.cshtml)
which can be included in other Markdown and Razor Pages or fetched on demand with Ajax.

Markdown Fragments can be then included inside other markdown documents with the `::include` inline container, e.g:

:::pre
::include vue/formatters.md::
:::

Where it will be replaced with the HTML rendered markdown contents of fragments maintained in `_pages/_include`.

### Include Markdown in Razor Pages

Markdown Fragments can also be included in Razor Pages using the custom `MarkdownTagHelper.cs` `<markdown/>` tag:

```html
<markdown include="vue/formatters.md"></markdown>
```

### Inline Markdown in Razor Pages

Alternatively markdown can be rendered inline with:

```html
<markdown>
## Using Formatters

Your App and custom templates can also utilize @servicestack/vue's
[built-in formatting functions](href="/vue/use-formatters).
</markdown>
```

### Meta Headers support for Twitter cards and Improved SEO

Blog Posts and Pages now include additional `<meta>` HTML Headers to enable support for 
[Twitter Cards](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/cards/overview/abouts-cards) in both
Twitter and Meta's new [threads.net](https://threads.net), e.g:

<div class="not-prose my-8 flex justify-center">
   <a class="block max-w-2xl" href="https://www.threads.net/@servicestack/post/CvIFobPBs5h">
      <div class="block flex justify-center shadow hover:shadow-lg rounded overflow-hidden">
         <img class="py-8" src="/img/pages/release-notes/v6.10/twitter-cards.png">
      </div>
   </a>
</div>

### Posts can include Vue Components

Blog Posts can now embed any global Vue Components directly in their Markdown, e.g: 

```html
<getting-started></getting-started>
```

Just like Pages and Docs they can also include specific JavaScript **.mjs** or **.css** in the `/wwwroot/posts` folder
which will only be loaded for that post:

<file-layout :files="{
    wwwroot: { 
        posts: { _: ['<slug>.mjs','<slug>.css'] },
    }
}"></file-layout>

Now posts that need it can dynamically load large libraries like [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org) and use it 
inside a custom Vue component, e.g:

```js
import { ref, onMounted } from "vue"
import { addScript } from "@servicestack/client"
const addChartsJs = await addScript('../lib/js/chart.js')

const ChartJs = {
    template:`<div><canvas ref="chart"></canvas></div>`,
    props:['type','data','options'],
    setup(props) {
        const chart = ref()
        onMounted(async () => {
            await addChartsJs
            const options = props.options || {
                responsive: true,
                legend: { position: "top" }
            }
            new Chart(chart.value, {
                type: props.type || "bar",
                data: props.data,
                options,
            })
        })
        return { chart }
    }
}

export default {
    components: { ChartJs }
}
```

Which allows the post to embed Chart.js charts using the custom `<chart-js>` Vue component and a JS Object literal, e.g: 

```html
<chart-js :data="{
    labels: [
        //...
    ],
    datasets: [
        //...
    ]
}"></chart-js>
```

Which the [Bulk Insert Performance](https://servicestack.net/posts/bulk-insert-performance) Blog Post uses extensively to embeds its
Chart.js Bar charts:

<chart-js :data="{
    labels: [
        '10,000 Rows',
        '100,000 Rows'
    ],
    datasets: [
        {
            label: 'SQLite Memory',
            backgroundColor: 'rgba(201, 203, 207, 0.2)',
            borderColor: 'rgb(201, 203, 207)',
            borderWidth: 1,
            data: [17.066, 166.747]
        },
        {
            label: 'SQLite Disk',
            backgroundColor: 'rgba(255, 99, 132, 0.2)',
            borderColor: 'rgb(255, 99, 132)',
            borderWidth: 1,
            data: [20.224, 199.697]
        },
        {
            label: 'PostgreSQL',
            backgroundColor: 'rgba(153, 102, 255, 0.2)',
            borderColor: 'rgb(153, 102, 255)',
            borderWidth: 1,
            data: [14.389, 115.645]
        },
        {
            label: 'MySQL',
            backgroundColor: 'rgba(54, 162, 235, 0.2)',
            borderColor: 'rgb(54, 162, 235)',
            borderWidth: 1,
            data: [64.389, 310.966]
        },
        {
            label: 'MySqlConnector',
            backgroundColor: 'rgba(255, 159, 64, 0.2)',
            borderColor: 'rgb(255, 159, 64)',
            borderWidth: 1,
            data: [64.427, 308.574]
        },
        {
            label: 'SQL Server',
            backgroundColor: 'rgba(255, 99, 132, 0.2)',
            borderColor: 'rgb(255, 99, 132)',
            borderWidth: 1,
            data: [89.821, 835.181]
        }
    ]
}"></chart-js>

### Light and Dark Mode Query Params

You can link to Dark and Light modes of your Razor SSG website with the `?light` and `?dark` query string params:

- [https://razor-ssg.web-templates.io/?dark](https://razor-ssg.web-templates.io/?dark)
- [https://razor-ssg.web-templates.io/?light](https://razor-ssg.web-templates.io/?light)

### Blog Post Authors can have threads.net and Mastodon links

The social links for Blog Post Authors can now include [threads.net](https://threads.net) and [mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social) links, e.g:

```json
{
  "AppConfig": {
    "BlogImageUrl": "https://servicestack.net/img/logo.png",
    "Authors": [
      {
        "Name": "Lucy Bates",
        "Email": "lucy@email.org",
        "ProfileUrl": "img/authors/author1.svg",
        "TwitterUrl": "https://twitter.com/lucy",
        "ThreadsUrl": "https://threads.net/@lucy",
        "GitHubUrl": "https://github.com/lucy"
        "MastodonUrl": "https://mastodon.social/@luch"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## RDBMS Bulk Inserts

The latest release of [OrmLite](https://docs.servicestack.net/ormlite/) includes Bulk Inserts implementations for
each [supported RDBMS](https://docs.servicestack.net/ormlite/installation) to support the most efficient
ways for inserting large amounts of data, which is encapsulated behind OrmLite's new `BulkInsert` API:

```csharp
db.BulkInsert(rows);
```

<div class="py-8 max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6">
    <lite-youtube class="w-full mx-4 my-4" width="560" height="315" videoid="3gO_OEWIyPo" style="background-image: url('https://img.youtube.com/vi/3gO_OEWIyPo/maxresdefault.jpg')"></lite-youtube>
</div>

### Bulk Insert Implementations

Where the optimal implementation for each RDBMS were all implemented differently:

- **PostgreSQL** - Uses PostgreSQL's [COPY](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-copy.html)
  command via Npgsql's [Binary Copy](https://www.npgsql.org/doc/copy.html) import
- **MySql** - Uses [MySqlBulkLoader](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-net/en/connector-net-programming-bulk-loader.html)
  feature where data is written to a temporary **CSV** file that's imported directly by `MySqlBulkLoader`
- **MySqlConnector** - Uses [MySqlConnector's MySqlBulkLoader](https://mysqlconnector.net/api/mysqlconnector/mysqlbulkloadertype/)
  implementation which makes use of its `SourceStream` feature to avoid writing to a temporary file
- **SQL Server** - Uses SQL Server's `SqlBulkCopy` feature which imports data written to an in-memory `DataTable`
- **SQLite** - SQLite doesn't have a specific import feature, instead Bulk Inserts are performed using batches of [Multiple Rows Inserts](https://www.tutorialscampus.com/sql/insert-multiple-rows.htm)
  to reduce I/O calls down to a configurable batch size
- **Firebird** - Is also implemented using **Multiple Rows Inserts** within an [EXECUTE BLOCK](https://firebirdsql.org/refdocs/langrefupd20-execblock.html)
  configurable up to Firebird's maximum of **256** statements

### SQL Multiple Row Inserts

All RDBMS's also support SQL's Multiple Insert Rows feature which is an efficient and compact alternative to inserting 
multiple rows within a single INSERT statement:

```sql
INSERT INTO Contact (Id, FirstName, LastName, Age) VALUES 
(1, 'John', 'Doe', 27),
(2, 'Jane', 'Doe', 42);
```

Normally OrmLite APIs uses parameterized statements however for Bulk Inserts it uses inline rasterized values in order
to construct and send large SQL INSERT statements that avoids RDBMS's max parameter limitations, which if preferred can
be configured to be used instead of its default optimal implementation:

```csharp
db.BulkInsert(rows, new BulkInsertConfig {
    Mode = BulkInsertMode.Sql
});
```

### Batch Size

**Multiple Row Inserts** are sent in batches of **1000** (Maximum for SQL Server), Firebird uses a maximum of **256**
whilst other RDBMS's can be configured to use larger batch sizes:

```csharp
db.BulkInsert(rows, new BulkInsertConfig {
    BatchSize = 1000
});
```

### Bulk Insert Benchmarks

To test the performance of Bulk Inserts we've ran a number of benchmarks across macOS, Linux and Windows in our
[Bulk Insert Performance](https://servicestack.net/posts/bulk-insert-performance) blog post.

The Relative performances of Apple M2 macOS Benchmarks provide some indication of the performance benefits of Bulk Inserts
you can expect, confirming that they offer much better performance when needing to insert a significant number of rows, 
we're it's up to **138x** more efficient than inserting just **1,000 rows**.

:::{.table .table-striped .text-base}

Relative performance for Inserting **1,000** records:

| Database       | Bulk Inserts | Multiple Rows Inserts | Single Row Inserts |
|----------------|-------------:|----------------------:|-------------------:|
| PostgreSQL     |           1x |                 1.32x |             57.04x |
| MySqlConnector |           1x |                 1.04x |            137.78x |
| MySql          |           1x |                 1.16x |            131.47x |
| SqlServer      |           1x |                 6.61x |             74.19x |

Relative performance for Inserting **10,000** records:

| Database       | Bulk Inserts | Multiple Rows Inserts |
|----------------|-------------:|----------------------:|
| PostgreSQL     |           1x |                 3.37x |
| MySqlConnector |           1x |                 1.24x |
| MySql          |           1x |                 1.52x |
| SqlServer      |           1x |                 9.36x |

Relative performance for Inserting **100,000** records:

| Database       | Bulk Inserts | Multiple Rows Inserts |
|----------------|-------------:|----------------------:|
| PostgreSQL     |           1x |                 3.68x |
| MySqlConnector |           1x |                 2.04x |
| MySql          |           1x |                 2.31x |
| SqlServer      |           1x |                10.14x |

It also shows that batched Multiple Row Inserts Bulk Insert mode is another good option for inserting large number of
rows that's within **3.4x** performance range of optimal Bulk Insert implementations, for all but SQL Server which
is an order of magnitude slower than using `SqlBulkCopy`.

## Transaction SavePoints

A savepoint is a special mark inside a transaction that allows all commands that are executed after it was established 
to be rolled back, restoring the transaction state to what it was at the time of the savepoint.

Transaction SavePoints have been added for all [supported RDBMS](https://docs.servicestack.net/ormlite/installation)
with the `SavePoint()` API which will let you Create and `Rollback()` to a SavePoint or `Release()` its resources, e.g:

```csharp
// Sync
using (var trans = db.OpenTransaction())
{
    try
    {
        db.Insert(new Person { Id = 2, Name = "John" });

        var firstSavePoint = trans.SavePoint("FirstSavePoint");

        db.UpdateOnly(() => new Person { Name = "Jane" }, where: x => x.Id == 1);

        firstSavePoint.Rollback();

        var secondSavePoint = trans.SavePoint("SecondSavePoint");

        db.UpdateOnly(() => new Person { Name = "Jack" }, where: x => x.Id == 1);

        secondSavePoint.Release();

        db.Insert(new Person { Id = 3, Name = "Diane" });

        trans.Commit();
    }
    catch (Exception e)
    {
        trans.Rollback();
    }
}
```

It's also includes equivalent async versions with `SavePointAsync()` to create a Save Point, `RollbackAsync()` and `ReleaseAsync()`
to Rollback and Release Save Points, e.g:

```csharp
// Async
using (var trans = db.OpenTransaction())
{
    try
    {
        await db.InsertAsync(new Person { Id = 2, Name = "John" });

        var firstSavePoint = await trans.SavePointAsync("FirstSavePoint");

        await db.UpdateOnlyAsync(() => new Person { Name = "Jane" }, where: x => x.Id == 1);

        await firstSavePoint.RollbackAsync();

        var secondSavePoint = await trans.SavePointAsync("SecondSavePoint");

        await db.UpdateOnlyAsync(() => new Person { Name = "Jack" }, where: x => x.Id == 1);

        await secondSavePoint.ReleaseAsync();

        await db.InsertAsync(new Person { Id = 3, Name = "Diane" });

        trans.Commit();
    }
    catch (Exception e)
    {
        trans.Rollback();
    }
}
```

## Multi Database Migrations

OrmLite's [code-first DB Migrations](/ormlite/db-migrations) now support running and reverting Migrations on multiple 
named connections which is a feature used in the 
[Install PostgreSQL, MySql and SQL Server on Apple Silicon](https://servicestack.net/posts/postgres-mysql-sqlserver-on-apple-silicon#multi-database-migrations)
Blog Post to populate test data in all configured RDBMS's:

```csharp
[NamedConnection("mssql")]
[NamedConnection("mysql")]
[NamedConnection("postgres")]
public class Migration1001 : MigrationBase
{
    //...
}
```

Although this feature is more useful for maintaining the same schema across multiple database shards, which is a 
[popular scaling technique](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/database-sharding/) to increase system capacity and improve response times:

```csharp
[NamedConnection("shard1")]
[NamedConnection("shard2")]
[NamedConnection("shard3")]
public class Migration1001 : MigrationBase
{
    //...
}
```

## SqlServer and Sqlite.Data for NET Framework

To enable creating cross-platform Apps that work across macOS, Linux, Windows on both **x86 and ARM** we're switching our
examples, Apps and Demos to use the [ServiceStack.OrmLite.SqlServer.Data](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ServiceStack.OrmLite.SqlServer.Data)
and [ServiceStack.OrmLite.Sqlite.Data](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ServiceStack.OrmLite.Sqlite.Data) NuGet packages
which now include **.NET Framework v4.7.2** builds to ensure they can run on all platforms.

We now recommend switching to these packages as they reference the more portable and actively maintained 
[Microsoft.Data.SqlClient](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Data.SqlClient) and 
[Microsoft.Data.Sqlite](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Data.Sqlite) ADO.NET NuGet packages.

## JSON Lines Data Format

[![](/img/pages/release-notes/v6.10/jsonl.png)](https://jsonlines.org)

[JSON Lines](https://jsonlines.org) is an efficient JSON data format parseable by streaming parsers and text processing tools 
like Unix shell pipelines, whose streamable properties is making it a popular data format for maintaining large datasets 
like the large AI datasets maintained on https://huggingface.co which is now accessible on [Auto HTML API](/auto-html-api) pages:

<div class="not-prose my-8 flex justify-center">
   <a class="block max-w-2xl" href="https://blazor-gallery.servicestack.net/albums">
      <div class="block flex justify-center shadow hover:shadow-lg rounded overflow-hidden">
         <img class="py-8" src="/img/pages/release-notes/v6.10/jsonl-format.png">
      </div>
   </a>
</div>

Which lists the `.jsonl` format like other data formats where it's accessible from `.jsonl` extension for `?format=jsonl` query string, e.g:

 - https://blazor-gallery.servicestack.net/albums.jsonl
 - https://blazor-gallery.servicestack.net/api/QueryAlbums?format=jsonl

### CSV Enumerable Behavior

The JSON Lines data format behaves the same way as the CSV format where if your Request DTO is annotated with either 
`[DataContract]` or the more explicit `[Csv(CsvBehavior.FirstEnumerable)]` it will automatically serialize the 
**first IEnumerable property**, where all [AutoQuery APIs](/autoquery/) and the Request DTO's below will return their
`IEnumerable` datasets in the streamable JSON Lines format:

```csharp
public class QueryPocos : QueryDb<Poco> {}

[Route("/pocos")]
public class Pocos : List<Poco>, IReturn<Pocos>
{
    public Pocos() {}
    public Pocos(IEnumerable<Poco> collection) : base(collection) {}
}

[Route("/pocos")]
[DataContract]
public class Pocos : IReturn<Pocos>
{
    [DataMember]
    public List<Poco> Items { get; set; }
}

[Route("/pocos")]
[Csv(CsvBehavior.FirstEnumerable)]
public class Pocos : IReturn<Pocos>
{
    public List<Poco> Items { get; set; }
}
```

### Async Streaming Parsing Example

The [HTTP Utils](/http-utils) extension methods makes it trivial to implement async streaming parsing where you can process
each row one at a time to avoid large allocations:

```csharp
const string BaseUrl = "https://blazor-gallery.servicestack.net";
var url = BaseUrl.CombineWith("albums.jsonl");
await using var stream = await url.GetStreamFromUrlAsync();
await foreach (var line in stream.ReadLinesAsync())
{
    var row = line.FromJson<Album>();
    //...
}
```

### JsonlSerializer

Alternatively if streaming the results isn't important it can be deserialized like any other format using the new `JsonlSerializer`:  

```csharp
var jsonl = await url.GetStringFromUrlAsync();
var albums = JsonlSerializer.DeserializeFromString<List<Album>>(jsonl);
```

Which can also serialize to a `string`, `Stream` or `TextWriter`:

```csharp
var jsonl = JsonlSerializer.SerializeToString(albums);
JsonlSerializer.SerializeToStream(albums, stream);
JsonlSerializer.SerializeToWriter(albums, textWriter);
```

## AddQueryParams HTTP Utils API

The new `AddQueryParams` and `AddNameValueCollection` extension methods makes easy to construct URLs from an Object Dictionary, e.g:

```csharp
var url = BaseUrl.CombineWith("albums.jsonl")
    .AddQueryParams(new() { ["titleContains"] = "Soundtrack", ["take"] = 10 });
```

## Pre Release NuGet Packages now published to Feedz.io

We started experiencing several reliability issues with [myget.org](https://www.myget.org) earlier this year which
prompted us to start deploying our pre-release packages to [GitHub Packages](https://docs.servicestack.net/gh-nuget)
as a fallback option, but since it doesn't allow anonymous public NuGet feeds we continued to public and direct customers to
use MyGet as it offered the least friction.

Unfortunately MyGet.org's [major outage on 26th July](https://www.reddit.com/r/dotnet/comments/159yigd/is_myget_gone_for_good/)
in which their entire website and services was down for more than a day prompted us to seek a permanent alternative.
After evaluating several alternatives we settled on [Feedz.io](https://feedz.io) as the most viable alternative, which
like MyGet offered anonymous public NuGet feeds, with full control over allowing us to delete/replace pre-release packages as needed.

The [Pre-release NuGet Packages](/pre-release) documentation have been updated with the new feed information, e.g. if you're
currently using MyGet your **NuGet.Config** should be updated to:

### NuGet.Config

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration>
  <packageSources>
    <add key="ServiceStack Pre-Release" value="https://f.feedz.io/servicestack/pre-release/nuget/index.json" />
    <add key="nuget.org" value="https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json" protocolVersion="3" />
  </packageSources>
</configuration>
```

Alternatively this **NuGet.Config** can be added to your solution with the [x dotnet tool](/dotnet-tool):

:::sh
x mix feedz
