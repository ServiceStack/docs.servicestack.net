Happy New 2020 All! Hope everyone's had an enjoyable and relaxing break over the holidays and are re-energized to usher in the new decade. 

[![](/img/pages/grpc/grpc-horizontal-color.svg?sanitize=true)](https://grpc.io)

We're super excited to open the year with the premier feature in this release **ServiceStack gRPC**, our highly-productive entry into the 
[gRPC](https://grpc.io) universe with a number of value-added additions that makes developing and consuming gRPC Services a joy with USPs 
that leverages and preserves your existing knowledge and investments and maximizes the utility of your Services offering unprecedented value 
for your development efforts.

## .NET Core 3.1 LTS

With the release of [.NET Core 3.1 LTS](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1/) we've standardized our Project Templates
and tools to **.NET Core 3.1 LTS** whilst continuing to support existing **.NET Core 2.1+** and **.NET Framework** projects including 
[ASP.NET Core Apps on the .NET Framework](/templates/corefx).

You can view all available .NET Core Templates using the [x dotnet tool](/dotnet-tool) and running [x new](/dotnet-new):

    $ dotnet tool install --global x 
    $ x new

### .NET Core 3.1 LTS Project Templates

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/Assets/master/csharp-templates/vue-nuxt.png)](/web-new)

All [.NET Core Project Templates](/web-new) have been upgraded to 
[.NET Core 3.1 LTS](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1/) in this release including new 
[Generic Host](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/host/generic-host?view=aspnetcore-3.1) (i.e. non HTTP)
Project Templates configured with each of our [supported MQ Servers](/messaging) for running MQ-only workloads:

 - [worker-rabbitmq](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/worker-rabbitmq)
 - [worker-redismq](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/worker-redismq)
 - [worker-servicebus](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/worker-servicebus)
 - [worker-sqs](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/worker-sqs)

The new [x dotnet tool](/dotnet-tool) is exactly like the cross-platform `web` .NET Core 2.1 dotnet tool except for **.NET Core 3**,
which is required for making HTTP/2 requests on non-Windows platforms.

### .NET Core 3.1 Desktop Apps using latest Chromium

The `app` dotnet tool for running [.NET Core Chromium Desktop Apps](/netcore-windows-desktop) has been upgraded to use **.NET Core 3.1 LTS**
and the latest version of Chromium available in [CefGlue](https://gitlab.com/xiliumhq/chromiumembedded/cefglue).

[![](/img/pages/app/app-shortcut-icon.png)](/netcore-windows-desktop)

Thanks to [#Script's](https://sharpscript.net) dynamic and late-binding characteristics all [Sharp Apps](https://sharpscript.net/docs/sharp-apps) and 
[Gist Desktop Apps](https://sharpscript.net/docs/gist-desktop-apps) continue to run unmodified on both .NET Core 2.1 or .NET Core 3.1 `app` launchers.

## ServiceStack gRPC

ServiceStack's code-first message-based development approach offers a number of advantages over most gRPC Service frameworks
which rely on manually maintaining a separate plain-text `.proto` IDL files for defining your gRPC Services and reliance
on external tooling and binding to foreign code-generated classes.

With ServiceStack gRPC, there's no additional complexity, no manual maintenance of `.proto` files, no reliance on external tooling,
code-gen, etc is required to maintain its simple code-first development model utilizing clean POCOs which is still able to retain its ideal 
end-to-end Typed API utilizing smart, rich .NET generic Service Clients:

```csharp
//IRestServiceClient client = new JsonServiceClient(BaseUrl);
IRestServiceClient client = new GrpcServiceClient(BaseUrl);
var response = await client.GetAsync(new GetTodos());
```

Like other [.NET Service Clients](/csharp-client#built-in-clients), `GrpcServiceClient` is a substitutable full-featured Service Client 
should consumers prefer to revert to using other more versatile, interoperable, debuggable and ubiquitous serialization formats.

### Getting Started

The easiest way to get started is to start from a new [grpc](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/grpc) template that's a copy of the 
empty [web](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/web) project template pre-configured with gRPC support:

    $ dotnet tool install --global x 
    $ x new grpc MyGrpcProject

### ServiceStack Services are gRPC Services

Whilst Protocol Buffers imposes [additional restrictions](/grpc#limitations) on the Types that can be returned, in general the only change to
ServiceStack Services following our [recommended API Design](/api-design) are to add .NET's `[DataContract]` and `[DataMember]` attributes 
on each DTO member assigning unique field index to each property, i.e. what's required to support existing [ProtoBuf Services](/protobuf-format)
or used to customize XML wire format in ServiceStack's XML or [SOAP Services](/soap-support).

For an example, here's the complete annotated `GetTodos` Service from [todo-world](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/todo-world) gRPC Service:

```csharp
[DataContract]
public class GetTodos : IReturn<GetTodosResponse> {}

[DataContract]
public class GetTodosResponse
{
    [DataMember(Order = 1)]
    public List<Todo> Results { get; set; }

    [DataMember(Order = 2)]
    public ResponseStatus ResponseStatus { get; set; }
}

[DataContract]
public class Todo
{
    [DataMember(Order = 1)]
    public long Id { get; set; }

    [DataMember(Order = 2)]
    public string Title { get; set; }

    [DataMember(Order = 3)]
    public int Order { get; set; }

    [DataMember(Order = 4)]
    public bool Completed { get; set; }
}

public class TodoServices : Service
{
    public static List<Todo> Todos { get; } = new List<Todo>();
    public object Get(GetTodos request) => new GetTodosResponse { Results = Todos };
}
```

As gRPC mandates a static service contract (i.e. only returns the same Response DTO Type) Request DTOs are required to 
adhere to ServiceStack best practices and be annotated with either `IReturn<TResponse>` or `IReturnVoid` interfaces. 

> Only services annotated with `IReturn*` interfaces and member indexes (as above) will be registered as gRPC Services.

Trying to call a Service without these annotations will result in an error that the Service you're trying to call doesn't exist.

### Enable gRPC Services in existing .NET Core 3 projects

By default this Service is available in [all of ServiceStack's supported formats](/formats), to also make it available via ASP.NET Core's
gRPC Endpoints you can [mix it](/mix-tool) into [Modular Startup](/modular-startup) projects with:

    $ x mix grpc

Which applies this [modular ConfigureGrpc configuration](https://gist.github.com/gistlyn/656c29a7257dc374d22d4aa709ba7244) to your project.

Or to manually configure gRPC support, add a reference to the .NET Core 3 **ServiceStack.Extensions** NuGet package:

    $ dotnet add package ServiceStack.Extensions

Add the necessary dependencies:

```csharp
public void Configure(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddServiceStackGrpc();
}
```

Then register the `GrpcFeature` Plugin in your `AppHost`:

```csharp
Plugins.Add(new GrpcFeature(App));
```

Which registers all applicable ServiceStack Services with ASP.NET Core's gRPC Endpoint and provides an auto-generated 
[Add ServiceStack Reference](/add-servicestack-reference) `/types/proto` metadata endpoint that Google's protoc generated clients can use
to generate typed client proxies in each of the languages Google's gRPC supports.

### Maximize reuse of Knowledge and Investments

Likely the biggest advantage in using ServiceStack to develop gRPC Services is being able to (without additional knowledge) 
leverage your existing investments and knowledge of building HTTP Services which in most cases (after applying above annotations) 
are automatically made available as gRPC Services. This maximizes utility of your Services which can be simultaneously made available
via ASP.NET's gRPC Endpoints and ServiceStack's HTTP and MQ Endpoints alleviating the need to fork or duplicate your Services logic
across multiple implementations, or worse, taking the leap to develop gRPC-only services and shutting out clients and environments that
can't make use of gRPC HTTP/2 endpoints.

ServiceStack enables the best of both worlds, you can take the risk-free step of making your Services available via highly efficient and performant
gRPC HTTP/2 Services for clients and environments that can take advantage of it whilst (in the same App) continuing to make them available via the 
ubiquitous JSON HTTP/1.1 APIs or in any of their [preferred formats](/formats).

### Code-First gRPC Services

By allowing the use of idiomatic C# POCOs to define your Services contract, code-first always enables a superior development experience
which avoids having to rely on external build tools to generate foreign implementation-encumbered types limited in capability
by what's generated by its opaque tooling where it emits single-purpose Types limited for usage in gRPC Services - restricted
to the lowest common denominator capabilities of `.proto` files.

By contrast with a code-first approach your idiomatic C# POCOs remain the master authority for your Services contract in which you retain 
full control over, that can be further enhanced with attributes to enlist declarative behavior and shared interfaces and are in 
general inherently easier to develop genericized behavior around. As [Service Models](/physical-project-structure#servicemodel-project) 
doesn't have any implementation dependencies they can be easily shared and [referenced in any .NET Project](/why-servicestack#target-multiple-platforms) 
and as clean POCOs they can serve as [multi-purpose models enabling maximum reuse](/service-complexity-and-dto-roles#the-simple-poco-life) 
where they can be utilized in all ServiceStack's POCO libraries as well being supported in [all of ServiceStack's supported formats](/formats).

### No additional complexity or artificial machinery

At its most productive usage in .NET Apps, ServiceStack offers the same highly-productive friction-free development experience 
that's enjoyed in its other [.NET Generic Service Clients](/csharp-client) - requiring no tooling, code-generation or any other
artificial machinery, as the same clean POCO DTOs used to define your Services can be reused on the client where by preserving any 
additional annotations or interfaces that can allow for a richer client development experience.

An alternative to sharing your **ServiceModel.dll** with .NET clients is for them to use [Add ServiceStack Reference](/add-servicestack-reference)
to generate .NET DTOs locally which they can easily do using the [x dotnet tool](/dotnet-tool), e.g:

    $ x csharp https://todoworld.servicestack.net

This offers the same behavior as sharing **ServiceModel.dll** binary where they can be used in any 
[.NET Generic Service Client](/csharp-client#built-in-clients), but also allows for clients to 
[customize DTO generation](/csharp-add-servicestack-reference#dto-customization-options) to suit their own preferences.

### Smart, Substitutable, Generic GrpcServiceClient

Despite requiring much less complexity, the use of a generic Service Client offers a superior development model then what's 
available in Google's `protoc` generated Service Clients that's also able to be enjoyed by VB.NET and F# App developers 
for whom previously there was no planned gRPC support.

The new `GrpcServiceClient` can be used in **.NET Standard 2.1** and **.NET Core 3** .NET Clients by adding a reference to:

    $ dotnet add package ServiceStack.GrpcClient

This is a full-featured generic Service Client that provides a nicer and cleaner API than what's possible with `protoc` generated clients
and contains most of the built-in functionality of other [C#/.NET Typed Generic Clients](/csharp-client), namely:

  - Substitutable `IRestServiceClient`, `IServiceClientAsync` and `IServiceClientSync` interfaces
  - [Rich Detailed and Structured](/validation) Typed Exceptions
  - Built-in Credentials, JWT, API Key and Session Authentication
    - Transparent auto retry on expired JWT Bearer Tokens after retrieving new JWT from configured Refresh Token
  - Auto populates Version/Auth info in `IHasSessionId`, `IHasBearerToken` and `IHasVersion` Request DTOs
  - Batched API support via `SendAll/Async` and `PublishAll/Async` APIs
  - Global and Instance Request/Response Filters to apply generic custom logic on each request
  - C# 8 `await foreach` friendly `async IAsyncEnumerable<TResponse> Stream()` APIs for Server Stream gRPC Services

Importantly `GrpcServiceClient` implements the same interfaces shared by other [C#/.NET Typed Generic Clients](/csharp-client) allowing
development of higher-level shared client logic and libraries decoupled from concrete implementations, improved testability,
easy substitution to other clients for improved debuggability or working around limitations in protocol buffers,
as well as parallel client/server development where devs can temporarily bind to mock clients before server APIs are implemented.

The predetermined Generic API Surface area of the service client interfaces also makes it easier to develop enhanced functionality like
[Cache Aware Service Clients](/cache-aware-clients) in future that existing Apps will be able to utilize via a minimally disruptive "drop-in" implementation.

#### ServiceStack Interceptor for protoc generated clients

As `GrpcServiceClient` offers a nicer UX its usage over `protoc` generated clients should generally be preferred, one area where you'll want 
to consider using Google's `protoc` generated clients is in AOT environments like Xamarin.iOS as the `protoc` tooling 
emits AOT-friendly Protocol Buffer serialization implementations within its code generated Types.

To better accommodate scenarios where `protoc` clients are used you can use the `ServiceStackClientInterceptor` (also in **ServiceStack.GrpcClient**)
to replicate most of the rich ServiceStack integration features that's possible to implement using an `Interceptor`.

ServiceStack's Interceptor can be registered using `GrpcServiceStack.Client()` when creating the protoc `GrpcServicesClient`:

```csharp
// Insecure plain-text example
GrpcClientFactory.AllowUnencryptedHttp2 = true;
var client = new GrpcServices.GrpcServicesClient(
    GrpcServiceStack.Client("http://todoworld.servicestack.net:5054"));

// SSL Example
var client = new GrpcServices.GrpcServicesClient(
    GrpcServiceStack.Client("https://todoworld.servicestack.net:50051", 
        new X509Certificate2("grpc.crt"),
        GrpcUtils.AllowSelfSignedCertificatesFrom("todoworld.servicestack.net")));

// Optional (avoid protobuf-net deserialization)
GrpcServiceStack.ParseResponseStatus = bytes => ResponseStatus.Parser.ParseFrom(bytes);
```

### Preserve rich Semantics and API Design

gRPC Services enables an efficient long-lived HTTP/2 multiplexed channel with performant Protocol Buffer serialization and a 
vast code-generation framework allowing us to provide Typed clients for most major programming languages.

An area that could see a regression which all RPC frameworks suffer from is the erosion of the 
[Goals of Service Design](/why-servicestack#goals-of-service-design) and loss of loosely-coupled resource-oriented HTTP API Design
centered around applying actions (aka HTTP Verbs) to the request subjects, laying out a logical structure for your API Design that's 
also able to better communicate at a higher-level the commonly understood properties of each HTTP method.

Forcing the usage of **messages** in gRPC Service Requests partially mitigates against the 
[fragile usage of chatty client-specific method signatures](/why-servicestack#wcf-the-anti-dto-web-services-framework)
plagued by most RPC frameworks like WCF, but still makes it easy for API designs to descend into a logically unstructured "free-for-all" 
surface area adopting non-standard conventions making it harder and requiring more effort to convey understanding to your API consumers.

By continuing to develop your ServiceStack Services as a good HTTP First citizens using coarse-grained loosely-coupled messages 
oriented around resources, a lot of the rich HTTP semantics is preserved where each Verb remains accessible where its prefixed at the start 
of the rpc Method name:

    rpc [Verb][RequestType](RequestType) returns (ResponseType) {}

The original HTTP Status Code remains accessible from the **httpstatus** gRPC Metadata Response Header that continues to be populated
in the `WebServiceException.StatusCode` thrown in `GrpcServiceClient` or `protoc` clients configured with the ServiceStack Interceptor.
Any Custom HTTP Headers added by your Services are also returned in gRPC headers including your Services detailed structured Exception
information stored as a serialized `ResponseStatus` message in the **responsestatus-bin** Header that continues to be available in
`WebServiceException.ResponseStatus` property allowing gRPC client Apps to develop [rich form validation bindings](/world-validation#contacts-page)
that's otherwise not possible in gRPC's failed responses containing just an error code and simple text description.

### Offer best API for every platform

Given the trade-offs of gRPC we still expect the traditional and more ubiquitous HTTP/REST API endpoints to be more widely utilized 
in areas where you don't control both client and server Apps, where simplicity and interoperability is more important 
than maximum performance, when needing to support Ajax requests in Web Apps where HTTP/JSON is the lingua franca with rich support 
baked into many JS libraries or if needing to support environments where deeper integration of different formats is preferred, e.g. utilizing
[CSV Format](/csv-format) in Excel based workflows or importing datasets into Databases where it's natively supported in most RDBMS's tooling.

With the additional "complexity tax" for adopting a gRPC-based solution workflow, many App developers are still going to prefer the
simplicity of consuming a HTTP/JSON API from a URL and HTTP API docs.

As gRPC is just another endpoint for your ServiceStack Services you don't have to take the risk of committing to one scenario
at the expense of all others and can continue to serve all client consumers with the best API for every platform simultaneously. 

## Architecture

Unlike in other Services where ServiceStack handles writing the response directly to the HttpResponse, ServiceStack's gRPC Services 
are the implementation for ASP.NET Core gRPC Endpoint requests where it makes use of [Marc Gravell's](https://github.com/mgravell)
code-first [protobuf-net.Grpc](https://github.com/protobuf-net/protobuf-net.Grpc) library to enable ServiceStack's code-first development model 
of using typed Request/Response DTOs to implement and consume gRPC Services.

![](/img/pages/grpc/grpc-request.svg?sanitize=true)

Requests are executed using the [RpcGateway](/order-of-operations#rpcgateway) which returns the Response DTO back to ASP .NET Core gRPC 
which handles sending the response back to the HTTP/2 connected client. 

### RpcGateway

The `RpcGateway` provides a pure object model API for executing requests through the full HTTP Request pipeline including converting all Errors 
inc. short-circuited Request Pipeline requests into an Error ResponseStatus that's populated into the Response DTO's `ResponseStatus`.

The `RpcGateway` is available via the single `AppHost.RpcGateway` API:

```csharp
Task<TResponse> ExecuteAsync<TResponse>(object requestDto, IRequest req)
```

Unlike MQ Requests which uses `ServiceController.ExecuteMessage` to execute **internal/trusted** Services, the `RpcGateway` executes the full 
[HTTP Request Pipeline](/order-of-operations#rpcgateway) where requests are executed through the same global Request/Response filters that 
normal HTTP ServiceStack Services execute making them suitable for executing external **untrusted** requests.

The `RpcGateway` will simplify future integrations into external facing service endpoints, e.g. for proprietary endpoints or should there
be a next successor to gRPC.

## Limitations

Protocol Buffers have a number of restrictions in Types it supports:

### Inheritance

In its pursuit of defining a universal service description that can be both implemented and consumed by each major programming language,
Google's gRPC `.proto` and Protocol Buffers suffers from the limitations of needing to abide by the lowest common denominator functionality
available in all languages that's limited to use 
[Protocol Buffers built-in and Well Known Types](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf) 
which is much more restrictive than schema-less formats like JSON where the Type definition is retained in native POCOs used to de/serialize JSON.

The Types of limitations applicable when building gRPC Services in .NET include:

 - No support for Generic Types
 - No proper support for Inheritance
 - All enums need a zero value
 - All top-level enum names to be **globally unique** across all enums used in your Services
 - No built-in Types that can accommodate .NET's `Decimal`, `Guid` Types
 - Loss of precision when using the built-in `Timestamp` to serialize .NET's `DateTime` or `DateTimeOffset`

The [protobuf-net](https://github.com/protobuf-net/protobuf-net) library used in both Server and `GrpcServiceClient` implementations does its best to transparently work around above limitations, e.g:

 - Creates multiple messages using reified generic type names for each concrete Generic Type used
 - Allows defining layout of base Types to embed ("has a") relation of known sub types
 - Emits `ZERO` enum value for enums without `0` default values
    - Due to unique naming enum scoping rules it's an error to do this for more than 1 Enum
 - Utilizing custom Types defined in an accompanying `bcl.proto` to support .NET's `Decimal`, `Guid` Types
 - Other BCL Types like `DateTimeOffset` can be [supported via surrogates](https://github.com/protobuf-net/protobuf-net/issues/226#issuecomment-319564317)

## Features

In addition to its code-first development model ServiceStack gRPC adds a number of useful features to simplify and provide a richer gRPC
Services development experience:

### protobuf-net Inheritance

In order to support inheritance [protobuf-net has to retrofit](https://github.com/protobuf-net/protobuf-net/wiki/Getting-Started#inheritance) 
its support by embedding sub classes as different fields in the base class type. This is awkward since all known sub classes needs to be defined 
upfront on the base type using a consistent and non-conflicting numerical field id. 

As it's required by [AutoQuery](/autoquery/) it was important to best provide a seamless out-of-the-box solution to alleviate as much friction
as possible, so ServiceStack pre-configures this numerical index on all known sub types in your Services Contract with a generated
[Murmur2 hash](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/145633/14025) (best overall for speed/randomness) of the **Types Name** that's modded to 
within the `2^29-1` range of [valid field ids in protocol buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#assigning-field-numbers) -
resulting in a low (but still possible) index collision.

To instead use your own user-defined field id for inherited classes you can use the `[Id]` attribute, for AutoQuery Services it should 
at least start from `10` to avoid conflicts with its base class properties, e.g:

```csharp
[DataContract, Id(10)]
public class QueryRockstars : QueryDb<Rockstar>
{
    [DataMember(Order = 1)]
    public int? Age { get; set; }
}
```

The `[Id]` needs to be **unique across all Sub Types** and must not conflict with base class field ids, given AutoQuery Services share the same base-class, 
any user-defined `[Id(N)]` used needs to be **unique across all your AutoQuery Services**.

Both implicit or explicit `[Id]` inherited Types works nicely with the generic `GrpcServiceClient` where it allows calling the base and 
Sub Type properties, e.g:

```csharp
var response = await client.GetAsync(new QueryRockstars { Age = 27, Include = "Total" });
```

Unfortunately usage of inheritance is [currently not compatible with protoc clients](https://github.com/protobuf-net/protobuf-net.Grpc/issues/50) 
so in order to call AutoQuery Services from protoc generated clients you can utilize **Dynamic gRPC Requests** to execute any Service from an 
loosely-typed string dictionary.

### Dynamic gRPC Requests

Dynamic Requests lets you to populate Request DTOs of gRPC Services with a `DynamicRequest` DTO in the same way as **QueryString** and **FormData**
is used to populate a Request DTO, in this case `DynamicRequest` is just a Request DTO containing a string dictionary:

```csharp
[DataContract]
public class DynamicRequest
{
    [DataMember(Order = 1)]
    public Dictionary<string, string> Params { get; set; }
}
```

> Which just like QueryStrings/FormData are also able to [populate deeply nested object graphs from a JSV string](/serialization-deserialization)

By default ServiceStack only generates Dynamic Services for Services annotated with the `[Tag("Dynamic")]` attribute, e.g:

```csharp
[Tag(Keywords.Dynamic)]
[DataContract]
public class QueryRockstars : QueryDb<Rockstar>
{
    [DataMember(Order = 1)]
    public int? Age { get; set; }
}
```

This generates an additional Service that uses a `DynamicRequest` DTO input, in the format:

    rpc [Verb]Dynamic[RequestType](DynamicRequest) returns (ResponseType) {}

For the `QueryRockstars` above, it generates:

    rpc GetDynamicQueryRockstars(DynamicRequest) returns (QueryResponse_Rockstar) {}

Dynamic Requests are useful when you'd prefer to be able to populate Requests from an untyped string Dictionary such as implementing
a [dynamic Query Builder UI](https://github.com/ServiceStack/Admin) which would require significantly less effort and boilerplate 
then trying to map dynamic rules into populating a typed Request.

They're also required for calling Services that doesn't have an explicit Service contract like any untyped
[AutoQuery Services utilizing implicit conventions](/autoquery/rdbms#implicit-conventions), e.g:

```csharp
public class QueryRockstars : QueryDb<Rockstar> {}
```

Until [protoc clients are compatible with protobuf-net inheritance](https://github.com/protobuf-net/protobuf-net.Grpc/issues/50) they can
be used as an alternative for calling inheritance-based Request DTOs like AutoQuery.

The `CreateDynamicService` predicate determines which Services should have dynamic requests generated for it, by default it's limited
to Request DTOs annotated with `[Tag("Dynamic")]`, but can also be made to have dynamic requests generated for **all AutoQuery Services** with:

```csharp
Plugins.Add(new GrpcFeature(App) {
    CreateDynamicService = GrpcConfig.AutoQueryOrDynamicAttribute
});
```

When configured each AutoQuery Service will have an additional Service starting with `GetDynamic*` available that can be called with
a `DynamicRequest`, in fact the same `DynamicRequest` can be used to call either Typed or Untyped AutoQuery Services, e.g:

```csharp
var response = await client.GetDynamicQueryRockstarsAsync(new DynamicRequest {
    Params = {
        { "Age", "27" }, 
        { "OrderBy", "FirstName" },
        { "Include", "Total" },
    }
});
```

In addition to populating the Request DTO each dynamic param will also be available to your services via the `IRequest.QueryString` collection.

### Simulate HTTP Requests

Similar to `DynamicRequest` even normal typed gRPC Service requests can be augmented with gRPC Metadata Request Headers where they can be used
to be able to simulate an HTTP Request where headers starting with:

 - `query.` - added to `IRequest.QueryString`
 - `form.` - added to `IRequest.FormData`
 - `cookie.` - added to `IRequest.Cookies`
 - `header.` - added to `IRequest.Headers` (default)
 - Remaining headers without above prefixes are added to `IRequest.Headers` as-is.

This can be used to simulate a valid HTTP Request for Filters, Plugins and HTTP APIs that are specific in how they analyze HTTP Requests.

So just like `DynamicRequest` you can use dynamic gRPC Metadata Headers to populated typed gRPC Service requests, e.g:

```csharp
var client = new GrpcServiceClient(baseUrl) {
    RequestFilter = ctx => {
        ctx.RequestHeaders.Add("UserAgent", "Googlebot/2.1 (+http://www.google.com/bot.html)"); //impersonate
        ctx.RequestHeaders.Add("query.Age", "27");
        ctx.RequestHeaders.Add("query.OrderBy", "FirstName");
        ctx.RequestHeaders.Add("query.Include", "Total");
    }
};
var response = await client.GetAsync(new QueryRockstars());
```

Where each matching property will populate the Request DTO with the string value using the conversion rules in 
[ServiceStack's Auto Mapping](/auto-mapping).

If you don't wish for Headers to be able to populate Typed gRPC Requests, it can be disabled with:

```csharp
Plugins.Add(new GrpcFeature(App) {
    DisableRequestParamsInHeaders = true
});
```

### Server Stream gRPC Services

All gRPC Services we've seen so far are what gRPC Refers to as **Unary RPC**, i.e. where clients sends a single request to the server and 
gets a single response back. Another very useful communication style supported by gRPC is **Server streaming**:

> the client sends a request to the server and gets a stream to read a sequence of messages back. The client reads from the returned stream 
until there are no more messages. gRPC guarantees message ordering within an individual RPC call.

#### StreamServerEvents

There are a couple of scenarios in ServiceStack where this communication channel is especially useful such as [Server Events](/server-events)
which operates in a similar style with clients connecting to a long-lived HTTP connection that streams back "real-time Events" over the
light and efficient [SSE](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/eventsource/basics/) standard natively supported in modern browsers.

Although as HTTP Requests are not normally used for maintaining long-lived connections they're susceptible to issues like buffering 
from App Servers, middleware and proxies and require implementing a bespoke health-check and auto-reconnect solution in order to maintain
interrupted service.

As a first class supported communication channel clients can instead leverage gRPC's library infrastructure which is perfectly suited for
streaming real-time Server Events over an efficient persistent HTTP/2 channel that's available from the `StreamServerEvents` gRPC Service:

    rpc ServerStreamServerEvents(StreamServerEvents) returns (stream StreamServerEventsResponse) {}

Which gives all `protoc` supported languages a Typed Client for consuming your [Server Events](/server-events).

#### GrpcServiceClient Streams

When using the generic `GrpcServiceClient` you're able to take advantage of C#'s 8 new `await foreach` syntax sugar for consuming gRPC Server Streams.

Its usage is analogous to all Server Events clients where your initial connection contains the channels you want to subscribe to receive notifications
from, e.g:

```csharp
var stream = client.StreamAsync(new StreamServerEvents {
    Channels = new[] { "todos" }
});
```

Then you can use `await foreach` to consume an endless stream of Server Events. Use `Selector` to identify the type of Server Event
whilst the complex-type body of each event message can be parsed from its JSON body, e.g:

```csharp
await foreach (var msg in stream)
{
    if (msg.Selector.StartsWith("todos.")) //custom todos.* events
    {
        var obj = JSON.parse(msg.Json); //body of message in JSON
        if (obj is Dictionary<string, object> map)
        {
            //todos.create + todos.update properties
            var id = map["id"];
            var title = map["title"];
            $"EVENT {msg.Selector} [{msg.Channel}]: #{id} {title}".Print(); 
        }
        else
        {
            //todos.delete id
            $"EVENT {msg.Selector} [{msg.Channel}]: {obj}".Print();
        }
    }
    else
    {
        // general server events, e.g cmd.onConnect, cmd.onJoin, cmd.onLeave
        $"EVENT {msg.Selector} [{msg.Channel}]: #{msg.UserId} {msg.DisplayName}".Print();
    }
}
```

If connected whilst running the [TodoWorld CRUD Example](https://todoworld.servicestack.net/#user-content-c-local-development-grpc-ssl-crud-example)
this stream will output something similar to:

    EVENT cmd.onConnect []: #-1 user1
    EVENT cmd.onJoin [todos]: #-1 user1
    EVENT todos.create [todos]: #1 ServiceStack
    EVENT todos.update [todos]: #1 gRPC
    EVENT todos.delete [todos]: 1

#### protoc Dart Streams

Other `protoc` languages will require using their own language constructs for consuming gRPC Streams,
here's the [example for Dart](https://todoworld.servicestack.net/#dart) that also has a pleasant API for consuming Server Streams:

```dart
var stream = client.serverStreamServerEvents(StreamServerEvents()..channels.add('todos'));
await for (var r in stream) {
    var obj = jsonDecode(r.json);
    if (r.selector.startsWith('todos')) {
        if (obj is Map) {
            print('EVENT ${r.selector} [${r.channel}]: #${obj['id']} ${obj['title']}');
        } else {
            print('EVENT ${r.selector} [${r.channel}]: ${obj}');
        }
    } else {
        print('EVENT ${r.selector} ${r.channels}: #${obj['userId']} ${obj['displayName']}');
    }
}
```

### Implementing Server Stream Services

As they're not your typical unary-style Request/Response service, Server Streams are handled and implemented a little differently
where in addition to inheriting ServiceStack's base `Service` class you'll need to implement the `IStreamService<TRequest,TResponse>`
interface and implement its `Stream()` method for your Server Stream implementation.

Here's the implementation of ServiceStack's built-in `StreamFiles` Service which accepts multiple virtual paths of files 
and returns the File contents and metadata in the same order:

```csharp
public class StreamFileService : Service, IStreamService<StreamFiles,FileContent>
{
    public async IAsyncEnumerable<FileContent> Stream(StreamFiles request, CancellationToken cancel = default)
    {
        var i = 0;
        var paths = request.Paths ?? TypeConstants.EmptyStringList;
        while (!cancel.IsCancellationRequested)
        {
            var file = VirtualFileSources.GetFile(paths[i]);
            var bytes = file?.GetBytesContentsAsBytes();
            var to = file != null
                ? new FileContent {
                    Name = file.Name,
                    Type = MimeTypes.GetMimeType(file.Extension),
                    Body = bytes,
                    Length = bytes.Length,
                }
                : new FileContent {
                    Name = paths[i],
                    ResponseStatus = new ResponseStatus {
                        ErrorCode = nameof(HttpStatusCode.NotFound),
                        Message = "File does not exist",
                    }
                };
            
            yield return to;

            if (++i >= paths.Count)
                yield break;
        }
    }
}
```

Although `StreamFiles` is already pre-registered, to register your own gRPC Stream Service add them to the `RegisterServices` collection:

```csharp
Plugins.Add(new GrpcFeature(App) {
    RegisterServices = {
        typeof(StreamFileService)
    }
});
```

> Or remove the pre-registered `StreamFileService` and `SubscribeServerEventsService` services to disable them

Clients can use `StreamFiles` to efficiently download multiple files over a single gRPC HTTP/2 Server Stream connection in their preferred order:

```csharp
var request = new StreamFiles {
    Paths = new List<string> {
        "/js/ss-utils.js",
        "/js/hot-loader.js",
        "/js/not-exists.js",
        "/js/hot-fileloader.js",
    }
};

var files = new List<FileContent>();
await foreach (var file in client.StreamAsync(request))
{
    files.Add(file);
}
```

With each `FileContent` result containing either the file contents and metadata or an error response for missing files, e.g:

```csharp
// files[0].Name = 'ss-utils.js'
// files[1].Name = 'hot-loader.js'
// files[2].ResponseStatus.ErrorCode = NotFound
// files[3].Name = 'hot-fileloader.js'
```

#### protoc Dart Example

Example of server streaming of files from a protoc generated Dart client:

```dart
var stream = client.serverStreamFiles(StreamFiles()..paths.addAll([
  '/js/ss-utils.js',
  '/js/hot-loader.js',
  '/js/hot-fileloader.js',
]));

await for (var file in stream) {
  var text = utf8.decode(file.body);
  print('FILE ${file.name} (${file.length}): ${text.substring(0, text.length < 50 ? text.length : 50)} ...');
}
```

## SSL Certificate Configuration

Please see the [gRPC SSL docs](/grpc/ssl) for information on how to secure your gRPC connections including scripts for creating custom self-signed
certificates and hosting public gRPC Services behind nginx reverse proxies.

## gRPC Clients

Visit [todoworld.servicestack.net](https://todoworld.servicestack.net) to explore how easy it is to consume ServiceStack gRPC Services in different languages.

[![](/img/pages/grpc/grpc-videos-generic.png)](https://todoworld.servicestack.net/#csharp-generic)

For most .NET Clients we recommend using our generic `GrpcServiceClient` with deeper ServiceStack integration that can be used with the 
richer [Add ServiceStack Reference](/add-servicestack-reference) POCO DTOs that implements the same shared Service Client interfaces
adopted by all ServiceStack's [.NET Service Clients](/csharp-client):

 - [C# / F# / VB.NET Smart GrpcServiceClient](/grpc/generic)

### protoc generated clients

[![](/img/pages/grpc/grpc-videos-protoc.png)](https://todoworld.servicestack.net/#csharp)

For all non .NET Clients and AOT environments like Xamarin.iOS we recommend using Google's `protoc` generated clients:

 - [C#](/grpc/csharp)
 - [Swift](/grpc/swift)
 - [Java](/grpc/java)
 - [Dart](/grpc/dart)
 - [Go](/grpc/go)
 - [Node.js](/grpc/nodejs)
 - [Python](/grpc/python)
 - [Ruby](/grpc/ruby)
 - [PHP](/grpc/php)
 
## gRPC Web

As it's [impossible to implement the HTTP/2 gRPC spec in the browser](https://grpc.io/blog/state-of-grpc-web/),
in order to be able to consume gRPC services from a browser a [gRPC Web Proxy](https://grpc.io/blog/state-of-grpc-web/#the-tech) is needed.

The current recommendation from the gRPC Web team is to 
[Configure the Envoy Proxy](https://grpc.io/docs/tutorials/basic/web/#configure-the-envoy-proxy) to forward
gRPC browser requests to the native gRPC endpoint, however as it adds more moving parts and 
additional complexity, if you're not already using envoyproxy we instead recommended using 
ServiceStack HTTP JSON Services, made possible since ServiceStack's gRPC 
Service implementations are also made available over REST-ful HTTP APIs - i.e. the lingua franca of the web.

If [ASP.NET Core adds native gRPC Web support](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-dotnet/issues/99) then using gRPC
clients may provide a more appealing option although it won't have a clean, versatile and rich API as 
[TypeScript Add ServiceStack Reference](/typescript-add-servicestack-reference).

### x dotnet tool gRPC Web support

If wanting to evaluate using a gRPC Web Proxy you can use generate different TypeScript and JavaScript clients
using the commands below:

    $ x proto-ts <url>             # TypeScript + gRPC Web Text
    $ x proto-ts-binary <url>      # TypeScript + gRPC Web Binary
    $ x proto-js-closure <url>     # Google Closure + gRPC Web Text
    $ x proto-js-commonjs <url>    # Common JS + gRPC Web Text

Or if preferred you can use the online UI or HTTP API for generating Protocol Buffers and gRPC client proxies at 
[grpc.servicestack.net](https://grpc.servicestack.net).

## gRPC Configuration

There are a number of additional configuration options for customizing and extending ServiceStack's gRPC support:

### Protobuf Serialization

Behavior of how [protobuf-net](https://github.com/protobuf-net/protobuf-net) de/serializes .NET Models can be
customized by modifying `GrpcConfig.TypeModel` where any customizations should be applied to both
server and client apps if using [C# generic GrpcServiceClient](/grpc/generic).

### Any Methods

ServiceStack lets you define `Any()` services which can be invoked when called on each HTTP Method. To minimize
gRPC surface area pollution, by default ServiceStack only generates different **rpc** endpoints for HTTP's primary
`Get*`, `Post*`, `Put*` and `Delete*` verbs. 

To change this for **all Any services** specify which methods you want generated in `DefaultMethodsForAny` list,
e.g. you can specify to only generate `Get*` and `Post*` methods with:

```csharp
Plugins.Add(new GrpcFeature(App) {
    DefaultMethodsForAny = new List<string> { 
        HttpMethods.Get,
        HttpMethods.Post,
    }
});
```

As [AutoQuery Services](/autoquery/) are read-only queries they only default to generating `Get*` rpc methods, which can be changed with:

```csharp
Plugins.Add(new GrpcFeature(App) {
    AutoQueryMethodsForAny = new List<string> { 
        HttpMethods.Get,
        HttpMethods.Post,
    }
});
```

This can be customized per service by annotating your Request DTO with `IVerb` marker interfaces, e.g:

```csharp
[DataContract]
public class Hello : IReturn<HelloResponse>, IGet, IPost { ... }

public class MyServices : Service
{
    public object Any(Hello request) => ...;
}
```

Alternatively you can replace your `Any()` method and only implement the specific methods you want generated, e.g. `Get()` or `Post()`.

For even finer-grained customization you can override the `GenerateMethodsForAny` predicate to adopt your own conventions.

### Custom gRPC Status Codes

gRPC has are reduced number of [Error Status Codes](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/statuscodes.md) compared to what's available in HTTP,
you can override ServiceStack's built-in `HTTP > gRPC` mapping with your own implementation by populating `ToGrpcStatus`, e.g:

```csharp
Plugins.Add(new GrpcFeature(App) {
    ToGrpcStatus = httpRes => httpRes.StatusCode == 404
        ? new Status(StatusCode.NotFound, httpRes.StatusDescription)
        : (Status?) null // use default behavior
});
```

### Filtered HTTP Headers

You can control which of your custom HTTP Headers you don't want to return by adding them to the `IgnoreResponseHeaders` collection:

```csharp
Plugins.Add(new GrpcFeature(App) {
    IgnoreResponseHeaders = { HttpHeaders.ContentDisposition }
});
```

### Proto Options

The auto-generated `.proto` service description ServiceStack generates at `/types/proto` allows for 
[proto options](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#options) to customize `protoc` code-generation behavior
which are pre-configured with C# and PHP namespaces used in its generated proxy clients. 

You can include your own proto options by registering them in the `ProtoOptions` collection as seen below:

```csharp
Plugins.Add(new GrpcFeature(App) {
    ProtoOptions = new List<ProtoOptionDelegate> { 
        ProtoOption.CSharpNamespace,
        ProtoOption.PhpNamespace,
    }
});

public static class ProtoOption
{
    public static string CSharpNamespace(IRequest req, MetadataTypesConfig config) =>
        $"option csharp_namespace = \"{config.GlobalNamespace}\";";

    public static string PhpNamespace(IRequest req, MetadataTypesConfig config) =>
        $"option php_namespace = \"{config.GlobalNamespace}\";";
}
```

## Public gRPC protoc Service and UI

> [grpc.servicestack.net](https://grpc.servicestack.net)

[![](/img/pages/grpc/protoc-api.png)](https://grpc.servicestack.net)

To provide the simplest and seamless end-to-end gRPC solution we're maintaining a **[public gRPC protoc Service](https://grpc.servicestack.net)** 
and UI which is the backend empowering our cross-platform [dotnet tools](/dotnet-tool) to be able to generate Protocol Buffer DTOs
and gRPC clients in every `protoc` supported language without any installation, tooling or configuration required.

This is a public service **any gRPC clients using any gRPC Service framework** can use as an alternative for having each
client configure and maintain their build system to use protoc tooling.

Local **.proto** files aren't necessary for ServiceStack gRPC Services with gRPC clients only needing a URL, e.g:

    $ x proto-<lang> https://todoworld.servicestack.net

### From .proto descriptors

Other clients can generate protoc clients from either a single **.proto** services description:

    $ x proto-<lang> services.proto

Or upload multiple **.proto** files by specifying a directory instead:

    $ x proto-<lang> /path/to/grpc/protos

Use **-out** to specify a different directory to save the protoc generated classes to, e.g:

    $ x proto-<lang> services.proto -out /path/to/dir

### Using curl

Alternatively you can use curl command-line HTTP Client to download protoc generated classes in a **.zip** archive:

    $ curl -F 'file1=@services.proto' https://grpc.servicestack.net/protoc/[lang]?zip -L -o grpc.zip

Below is a complete list of different languages supported by this public gRPC Service:

| Lang | Description |
|-|-|
| cpp	       | C++  |
| csharp       | C#   | 
| dart         | Dart | 
| go           | Go   | 
| java         | Java | 
| java-lite    | Java (Lite) | 
| js-node      | JavaScript (node.js) | 
| objc         | Objective C | 
| php          | PHP | 
| python       | Python | 
| ruby         | Ruby | 
| swift        | Swift | 
| **gRPC Web Languages** | | 
| js-closure   | JavaScript (Closure) | 
| js-commonjs  | JavaScript (CommonJS) | 
| ts           | TypeScript | 
| ts-binary    | TypeScript (Binary) |
