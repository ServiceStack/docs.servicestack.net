We've got a couple of exciting features in this release opening ServiceStack up to new use-cases with the potential
of changing the internal code-architecture of ServiceStack Apps, especially those benefiting from the value and simplicity of running [SQLite on the Server](/ormlite/litestream).

## Commands Feature

Much of ServiceStack has been focused on providing a productive [API First Development](/api-first-development) experience and adding value-added features around your System's external APIs, including:

 - [Native end-to-end typed API integrations](/add-servicestack-reference) to **11 popular languages**
 - Built-in [API Explorer](/api-explorer) to discover, browse and invoke APIs
 - Instant CRUD UIs with [Auto Query](/autoquery/) and [Locode](/locode/)
 - Custom CRUD UIs with [Blazor components](https://blazor-gallery.jamstacks.net) and [Vue Components](/vue/)
 
As well as [Declarative Validation](/declarative-validation), multiple [Auth Integrations](/auth/) and other extensive [Declarative Features](/locode/declarative) to enhance your external facing APIs.

### Internal API Implementation

Thus far little attention has been given to internal implementations of APIs since it can use anything that fulfils its 
service contract by returning the APIs populated Response DTO. 

How code-bases are structured is largely a matter of developer preference, however we believe we've also been able 
to add value in this area with the new appealing managed **Commands Feature**.

Use Commands to build robust and observable systems with Admin UI
:::

## Code Architecture 

Ultimately nothing beats the simplicity of "No Architecture" by maintaining all logic within a Service Implementation 
which just needs to call a few App dependencies to implement its functionality and return a populated Response DTO:

```csharp
public object Any(MyRequest request) => new MyResponse { ... };
```

This is still the best option for small implementations where the Service is the only consumer of the logic that should
be run on the HTTP Worker Request Thread.

#### When to restructure

Times when you may want to consider moving logic out of your Service into separate classes include:

- **Code Reuse**: Make it easier to reuse your Service logic in other Services
- **Complexity**: Break down complex logic into smaller more manageable pieces
- **Testability**: Make it easier to test your Logic in isolation
- **Observability**: Make it easier to log and monitor
- **Robustness**: Make it easier to handle, retry and recover from errors
- **Flexibility**: Make it easier to run in parallel or in a different managed thread

We'll look at how the new **Commands Feature** can help in these areas.

### Code Reuse

Following principles of YAGNI in doing the simplest thing that could possibly work, whenever we want to reuse logic
across Services we'd first start by moving it to an extension method on the dependency that it uses, e.g. 

```csharp
public static async Task<List<Contact>> GetActiveSubscribersAsync(
    this IDbConnection db, MailingList mailingList)
{        
    return await db.SelectAsync(db.From<Contact>(db.TableAlias("c"))
        .Where(x => x.DeletedDate == null && x.UnsubscribedDate == null && 
            x.VerifiedDate != null && (mailingList & x.MailingLists) == mailingList)
        .WhereNotExists(db.From<InvalidEmail>()
            .Where<Contact,InvalidEmail>((c,e) => 
                e.EmailLower == Sql.TableAlias(c.EmailLower, "c"))
            .Select(x => x.Id))
    );
}
```

Which does a great job at encapsulating logic and making it reusable and readable:

```csharp
foreach (var sub in await Db.GetActiveSubscribersAsync(MailingList.Newsletter)) {
    //...
}
```

Where it can be reused without referencing any external classes whilst also being easily discoverable via intelli-sense.    

This works great for 1 or 2 dependencies, but becomes more cumbersome as the number of dependencies grows, e.g: 

```csharp
public static async Task<List<Contact>> GetActiveSubscribersAsync(
    this IDbConnection db, ILogger log, ICacheClient cache, MailingList mailingList)
```

In which the complexity of the extension method dependencies leaks and impacts all calling classes that need to include
them and also starts to impact its readability, e.g:

```csharp
public class MyService(ILogger<MyService> log, ICacheClient cache, IDbConnection db) 
    : Service
{
    public object Any(MyRequest request)
    {
        var subs = await Db.GetActiveSubscribersAsync(log, cache, request.MailList);
    }
}
```

### Refactoring Logic into separate classes

The solution to this is to refactor the logic into a separate class and leverage the IOC to inject the dependencies it needs,
fortunately with Primary Constructors this now requires minimal boilerplate code, e.g:

```csharp
class MyLogic(ILogger<MyService> log, ICacheClient cache, IDbConnection db)
{
    //...
}
```

But it still requires manual registration adding additional complexity to 
your Host project `Program.cs` or [Modular Configurations](/modular-startup) which needs to 
manage registration for all these new logic classes, e.g: 

```csharp
builder.Services.AddTransient<MyLogic>();
```

## Async Commands

Which touches on the first benefit of the **Commands Feature** which like ServiceStack Services auto registers
all classes implementing the intentionally simple and impl-free `IAsyncCommand` interface, e.g:

```csharp
public interface IAsyncCommand<in T>
{
    Task ExecuteAsync(T request);
}
```

Allowing for maximum flexibility in how to implement your logic classes, which are essentially encapsulated
units of logic with a single method to execute it, e.g:

```csharp
public class AddTodoCommand(ILogger<AddTodoCommand> log, IDbConnection db) 
    : IAsyncCommand<CreateTodo>
{
    public async Task ExecuteAsync(CreateTodo request)
    {
        var newTodo = request.ConvertTo<Todo>();
        newTodo.Id = await db.InsertAsync(newTodo, selectIdentity:true);
        log.LogDebug("Created Todo {Id}: {Text}", newTodo.Id, newTodo.Text);
    }
}
```

Where we immediately get the benefits of code reuse, encapsulation, and readability without needing to manually 
register and pollute your App's configuration with them.

By default Commands are registered as transient dependencies, but you can also register them with a different lifetime
scope using the `[Lifetime]` attribute, e.g:

```csharp
[Lifetime(Lifetime.Scoped)]
public class AddTodoCommand(ILogger<AddTodoCommand> log, IDbConnection db)
    : IAsyncCommand<CreateTodo> {}
```

Or by manually registering them, if you need a custom registration:

```csharp
services.AddTransient<AddTodoCommand>(c => CreateAddTodoCommand(c));
```

### Commands with Results

For maximum flexibility, we want to encourage temporal decoupling by separating initiating a command from its execution, 
so instead of adding a different method to execute commands with results, we're instead recommending the convention of
storing the result of a command in a `Result` property, e.g:

```csharp
public interface IAsyncCommand<in TRequest, out TResult> 
    : IAsyncCommand<TRequest>, IHasResult<TResult> { }

public interface IHasResult<out T>
{
    T Result { get; }
}
```

So we could implement a command with a result like:

```csharp
public class AddTodoCommand(ILogger<AddTodoCommand> log, IDbConnection db) 
    : IAsyncCommand<CreateTodo, Todo>
{
    public Todo Result { get; private set; }
    
    public async Task ExecuteAsync(CreateTodo request)
    {
        Result = request.ConvertTo<Todo>();
        Result.Id = await db.InsertAsync(newTodo, selectIdentity:true);
        log.LogDebug("Created Todo {Id}: {Text}", Result.Id, Result.Text);
    }
}
```

### Messaging

Although for better resilience and scalability we recommend utilizing a messaging pattern to notify the outputs of a 
command by publishing messages to invoke dependent logic instead of returning a result, e.g:

```csharp
public class AddTodoCommand(IDbConnection db, IMessageProducer mq) 
    : IAsyncCommand<CreateTodo>
{
    public async Task ExecuteAsync(CreateTodo request)
    {
        var newTodo = request.ConvertTo<Todo>();
        newTodo.Id = await db.InsertAsync(newTodo, selectIdentity:true);
        mq.Publish(new SendNotification { TodoCreated = newTodo });
    }    
}
```

Which decouples the sender and receiver of the message, allowing it to finish without needing to wait and concern itself 
on how subsequent logic is processed, e.g. how to handle errors, whether to execute it in a different managed thread, in parallel, etc.

Messaging encourages adopting a more reliable asynchronous one-way workflow instead of implementing logic serially where 
the sender is timely coupled to the successful execution of all subsequent logic before being able to complete, e.g:

```csharp
await cmd.ExecuteAsync(createTodo);
var newTodo = cmd.Result;
await SendNewTodoNotificationAsync(newTodo);
```

It allows for more reliable and observable workflows that removes the temporal coupling between components where each 
execution step can be executed on different threads, independently monitored and retried if needed.

```txt
[A] -> [B] -> [C]
```

### Commands as Application Building Blocks

As they're not dependent on any framework and can support multiple execution patterns, we believe Commands make great 
building blocks for insulating units of logic as they're simple and testable and allow for managed execution which can 
easily add logging, monitoring, and resilience around your logic.

### Background MQ

It should be noted adopting a messaging pattern doesn't require additional infrastructure complexity of an external MQ Server
as you can use the [Background MQ](/background-mq) to execute messages in configurable managed background threads.

### Executing Commands

Commands are effectively a pattern to structure your logic that doesn't depend on any implementation assembly or 
framework, so they can just be executed directly, e.g:

```csharp
using var db = dbFactory.Open();
var cmd = new AddTodoCommand(new NullLogger<AddTodoCommand>(), db);
await cmd.ExecuteAsync(new CreateTodo { Text = "New Todo" });
```

### Command Executor

They also allow for a managed execution which the **CommandsFeature** provides with its `ICommandExecutor` which
can be executed like:

```csharp
public class MyService(ICommandExecutor executor) : Service
{
    public object Any(MyRequest request)
    {
        var cmd = executor.Command<AddTodoCommand>(); 
        await cmd.ExecuteAsync(new AddTodoCommand { Text = "New Todo" });
    }
}
```

This still results in the same behavior where exceptions are bubbled but also adds observability and resilience and
other niceties like executing any Fluent or Declarative Validation on Command Requests.

### Retry Failed Commands

We can make commands more resilient by adding the `[Retry]` attribute to opt into auto retrying failed commands:

```csharp
[Retry]
public class AddTodoCommand() : IAsyncCommand<CreateTodo> {}
```

Which will automatically retry the command as per the default Retry Policy:

```csharp
services.AddPlugin(new CommandsFeature
{
    DefaultRetryPolicy = new(
        Times: 3,
        Behavior: RetryBehavior.FullJitterBackoff,
        DelayMs: 100,
        MaxDelayMs: 60_000,
        DelayFirst: false
    )
});
```

That can be overridden on a per-command basis with the `[Retry]` attribute, e.g:

```csharp
[Retry(Times=4, MaxDelayMs=300_000, Behavior=RetryBehavior.LinearBackoff)]
public class AddTodoCommand() : IAsyncCommand<CreateTodo> {}
```

The different Retry Behaviors available include:

```csharp
public enum RetryBehavior
{
    // Use the default retry behavior
    Default,
    
    // Always retry the operation after the same delay
    Standard,
    
    // Should be retried with a linear backoff delay strategy
    LinearBackoff,

    // Should be retried with an exponential backoff strategy
    ExponentialBackoff,

    // Should be retried with a full jittered exponential backoff strategy
    FullJitterBackoff,
}
```

## Command Admin UI 

Which can be inspected in the new **Command Admin UI** where you can view summary stats of all executed Commands and **APIs** 
in the **Summary** tab, e.g:

[![](/img/pages/commands/AddTodoCommand-summary.png)](/img/pages/commands/AddTodoCommand-summary.png)

### Latest Command Executions

It also maintains a rolling log of the latest executed commands in the **Latest** tab:

[![](/img/pages/commands/AddTodoCommand-latest.png)](/img/pages/commands/AddTodoCommand-latest.png)

### Failed Command Executions

Whilst the **Errors** tab shows a list of all failed **Command** and **API** executions:

[![](/img/pages/commands/AddTodoCommand-errors.png)](/img/pages/commands/AddTodoCommand-errors.png)

### Execute Internal Commands

A benefit of using Commands as the building block for your internal logic is that they enjoy many of the same benefits
of ServiceStack's message-based Services where they can be invoked using just the Command **Name** and a **Request** Body
which allows them to be discovered and executed from the **Explore** Tab:

[![](/img/pages/commands/AddTodoCommand-execute.png)](/img/pages/commands/AddTodoCommand-execute.png)

In this way they can be treated like **Internal APIs** for being able to invoke internal functionality that's only accessible 
by **Admin** Users.

### Group Commands by Tag

Just like ServiceStack Services they can be grouped by **Tag** which can be used to group related commands: 

```csharp
[Tag("Todos")]
public class AddTodoCommand() : IAsyncCommand<CreateTodo> {}
```

## MQ Integration

Although `CommandsFeature` is a standalone feature we're registering it in the new Identity Auth Templates `Configure.Mq.cs`
which already uses the Background MQ to execute messages in managed background threads where it's used to send Identity Auth emails:

```csharp
public class ConfigureMq : IHostingStartup
{
    public void Configure(IWebHostBuilder builder) => builder
        .ConfigureServices((context, services) => {
            services.AddSingleton<IMessageService>(c => new BackgroundMqService());
            services.AddPlugin(new CommandsFeature());
        })
        .ConfigureAppHost(afterAppHostInit: appHost => {
            var mqService = appHost.Resolve<IMessageService>();

            //Register ServiceStack APIs you want to be able to invoke via MQ
            mqService.RegisterHandler<SendEmail>(appHost.ExecuteMessage);
            mqService.Start();
        });
}
```

Despite being 2 independent features, they work well together as the Background MQ can be used to execute Commands in
managed background threads of which a single thread is used to execute each Request Type by default (configurable per request).

You'd typically want to use queues to improve scalability by reducing locking and concurrency contention of heavy resources
by having requests queued and executed in a managed background thread where it's able to execute requests as fast as it can without contention. 
Queues are also a great solution for working around single thread limitations of resources like writes to SQLite databases.

## Use Case - SQLite Writes

As we've started to use server-side SQLite databases for our new Apps given its [many benefits](/ormlite/litestream)
we needed a solution to workaround its limitation of not being able to handle multiple writes concurrently.

One of the benefits of using SQLite is creating and managing multiple databases is relatively cheap, so we can mitigate
this limitation somewhat by maintaining different subsystems in separate databases, e.g:

[![](/img/pages/commands/pvq-databases.png)](/img/pages/commands/pvq-databases.png)

But each database can only be written to by a single thread at a time, which we can now easily facilitate with 
**Background MQ** and **MQ Command DTOs**.

### MQ Command DTOs

We can use the new `[Command]` attribute to be able to execute multiple commands on a single Request DTO Properties:

```csharp
[Tag(Tag.Tasks)]
[Restrict(RequestAttributes.MessageQueue), ExcludeMetadata]
public class DbWrites : IGet, IReturn<EmptyResponse>
{
    [Command<CreatePostVoteCommand>]
    public Vote? CreatePostVote { get; set; }
    
    [Command<CreateCommentVoteCommand>]
    public Vote? CreateCommentVote { get; set; }
    
    [Command<CreatePostCommand>]
    public Post? CreatePost { get; set; }
    
    [Command<UpdatePostCommand>]
    public Post? UpdatePost { get; set; }
    
    [Command<DeletePostsCommand>]
    public DeletePosts? DeletePosts { get; set; }
    
    [Command<DeleteAnswersCommand>]
    public DeleteAnswers? DeleteAnswers { get; set; }
    
    [Command<CreateAnswerCommand>]
    public Post? CreateAnswer { get; set; }
    
    [Command<PostSubscriptionsCommand>]
    public PostSubscriptions? PostSubscriptions { get; set; }
    
    [Command<TagSubscriptionsCommand>]
    public TagSubscriptions? TagSubscriptions { get; set; }    
    //...
}
```

Then to execute the commands we can use the `Request.ExecuteCommandsAsync` extension method for its 
Background MQ API implementation:

```csharp
public class BackgroundMqServices : Service
{
    public Task Any(DbWrites request) => Request.ExecuteCommandsAsync(request);
}
```

Which goes through all Request DTO properties to execute all populated properties with their associated
command, using it as the request for the command.

So after registering the `DbWrites` Command DTO with the MQ Service:

```csharp
mqService.RegisterHandler<DbWrites>(appHost.ExecuteMessage);
```

We can now publish a single `DbWrites` message to execute multiple commands in a single managed background thread:

```csharp
public class NotificationServices(MessageProducer mq) : Service
{
    public object Any(Watch request)
    {
        var userName = Request.GetClaimsPrincipal().GetUserName();

        mq.Publish(new DbWrites
        {
            PostSubscriptions = request.PostId == null ? null : new()
            {
                UserName = userName,
                Subscriptions = [request.PostId.Value],
            },
            TagSubscriptions = request.Tag == null ? null : new()
            {
                UserName = userName,
                Subscriptions = [request.Tag],
            },
        });
        
        mq.Publish(new AnalyticsTasks {
            WatchRequest = request,
        });
    }
}
```

We also benefit from its natural parallelism where write requests to different Databases are executed in parallel.

## API Keys

As we continue to embrace and natively integrate with ASP.NET Core's .NET 8 platform, we've reimplemented the last major
feature missing from ServiceStack Auth - support for API Keys!

### What are API Keys?

API Keys are a simple and effective way to authorize access to your APIs, which are typically used for machine-to-machine 
communication, where a client application needs to access an API without user intervention. 
API Keys are often used to control access to specific resources or features in your API, providing a simple way 
to manage access control.

### Redesigning API Keys

Building on our experience with API Keys in previous versions of ServiceStack, we've taken the opportunity to redesign
how API Keys work to provide a more flexible and powerful way to manage access control for your APIs.

The existing [API Key Auth Provider](/auth/api-key-authprovider) was implemented as 
another Auth Provider that provided another way to authenticate a single user. The consequences of this was:

 - Initial API Request was slow as it required going through the Authentication workflow to authenticate the user and setup authentication for that request
 - No support for fine-grained access control as API Keys had same access as the authenticated user
 - API Keys had to be associated with a User which was unnecessary for machine-to-machine communication

Given the primary use-case for API Keys is for machine-to-machine communication where the client isn't a User,
nor do they want systems using their API Keys to have access to their User Account, we've changed
how API Keys work in .NET 8.

## .NET 8 API Keys Feature

:::youtube U4vqOIHOs_Q
New .NET 8 API Keys Feature with Built-In UIs!
:::

The first design decision to overcome the above issues was to separate API Keys from Users and Authentication itself,
where the new `ApiKeysFeature` is now just a plugin instead of an Auth Provider, which can be added to existing Identity
Auth Apps with:

:::sh
x mix apikeys
:::

Which will add the API Keys [Modular Startup](/modular-startup) to your Host project, a minimal example of which looks like:

```csharp
public class ConfigureApiKeys : IHostingStartup
{
    public void Configure(IWebHostBuilder builder) => builder
        .ConfigureServices(services => {
            services.AddPlugin(new ApiKeysFeature());
        })
        .ConfigureAppHost(appHost => {
            using var db = appHost.Resolve<IDbConnectionFactory>().Open();
            var feature = appHost.GetPlugin<ApiKeysFeature>();
            feature.InitSchema(db);
        });
}
```

Where it registers the `ApiKeysFeature` plugin and creates the `ApiKey` table in the App's configured database if it
doesn't already exist.

### Creating Seed API Keys

The plugin can also be used to programmatically generate API Keys for specified Users:

```csharp
if (feature.ApiKeyCount(db) == 0)
{
    var createApiKeysFor = new [] { "admin@email.com", "manager@email.com" };
    var users = IdentityUsers.GetByUserNames(db, createApiKeysFor);
    foreach (var user in users)
    {
        // Create a super API Key for the admin user
        List<string> scopes = user.UserName == "admin@email.com"
            ? [RoleNames.Admin] 
            : [];
        var apiKey = feature.Insert(db, new() { 
            Name="Seed Key", UserId=user.Id, UserName=user.UserName, Scopes=scopes });
        
        var generatedApiKey = apiKey.Key;
    }
}
```

### Basic Usage

With the plugin registered, you can now use the `ValidateApiKey` attribute to limit APIs to only be accessible with a 
valid API Key, e.g:

```csharp
[ValidateApiKey]
public class MyRequest {}
```

### Use API Keys with our without Users and Authentication

API Keys can optionally be associated with a User, but they don't have to be, nor do they run in the context of a User
or are able to invoke any Authenticated APIs on their own. Users who create them can also limit their scope to only
call APIs they have access to, which can be done with user-defined scopes:

### Scopes

Scopes are user-defined strings that can be used to limit APIs from only being accessible with API Keys that have the 
required scope. For example, we could create generate API Keys that have **read only**, **write only** or **read/write** 
access to APIs by assigning them different scopes, e.g: 

```csharp
public static class Scopes
{
    public const string TodoRead = "todo:read";
    public const string TodoWrite = "todo:write";
}

[ValidateApiKey(Scopes.TodoRead)]
public class QueryTodos : QueryDb<Todo> {}

[ValidateApiKey(Scopes.TodoWrite)]
public class CreateTodo : ICreateDb<Todo>, IReturn<Todo> {}

[ValidateApiKey(Scopes.TodoWrite)]
public class UpdateTodo : IUpdateDb<Todo>, IReturn<Todo> {}

[ValidateApiKey(Scopes.TodoWrite)]
public class DeleteTodos : IDeleteDb<Todo>, IReturnVoid {}
```

Where only API Keys with the `todo:read` scope can access the `QueryTodos` API, and only API Keys with the `todo:write`
scope can access the `CreateTodo`, `UpdateTodo` and `DeleteTodos` APIs.

APIs that aren't assigned a scope can be accessed by any valid API Key.

The only built-in Scope is `Admin` which like the `Admin` role enables full access to all `[ValidateApiKeys]` APIs.

### Fine-grained Access Control

Alternatively API Keys can be restricted to only be able to access specific APIs.

### Features

In addition to scopes, API Keys can also be tagged with user-defined **Features** which APIs can inspect to enable 
different behavior, e.g. a **Paid** feature could be used to increase rate limits or return premium content whilst a 
**Tracking** feature could be used to keep a record of API requests, etc.

These can be accessed in your Services with:

```csharp
public object Any(QueryTodos request)
{
    if (Request.GetApiKey().HasFeature(Features.Paid))
    {
        // return premium content
    }
}
```

## Integrated UIs

Like many of ServiceStack's other premium features, API Keys are fully integrated into [ServiceStack's built-in UIs](https://servicestack.net/auto-ui)
including [API Explorer](/api-explorer) and the [Admin UI](/admin-ui).

### API Explorer

Your Users and API Consumers can use API Explorer to invoke protected APIs with their API Key. API Key protected APIs
will display a **key** icon next to the API instead of the **padlock** which is used to distinguish APIs that require
Authentication.

Users can configure API Explorer with their API Key by either clicking the **key** icon on the top right or by clicking
the **API Key** link on the alert message that appears when trying to access an API requiring an API Key:

![](/img/pages/auth/apikeys/apiexplorer-apikeys.png)

Both of these will open the **API Key** dialog where they can paste their API Key:

![](/img/pages/auth/apikeys/apiexplorer-apikeys-dialog.png)

:::info NOTE
API Keys are not stored in localStorage and only available in the current session
:::

### Admin UI

Whilst **Admin** users can view and manage API Keys in the API Key [Admin UI](/admin-ui) at:

:::{.text-4xl .text-center .text-indigo-800}
/admin-ui/apikeys
:::

![](/img/pages/auth/apikeys/admin-ui-apikeys.png)

This will let you view and manage all API Keys in your App, including the ability to revoke API Keys, extend their 
Expiration date as well as manage any Scopes and Features assigned to API Keys.

### Customizing API Key UIs

The `ApiKeysFeature` plugin can be configured to specify which **Scopes** and **Features** can be assigned to API Keys
as well as the different Expiration Options you want available in the API Key management UIs, e.g:

```csharp
services.AddPlugin(new ApiKeysFeature {
    // Optional: Available Scopes Admin Users can assign to any API Key
    Features = [
        Features.Paid,
        Features.Tracking,
    ],
    // Optional: Available Features Admin Users can assign to any API Key
    Scopes = [
        Scopes.TodoRead,
        Scopes.TodoWrite,
    ],
    // Optional: Limit available Expiry options that can be assigned to API Keys
    // ExpiresIn =[
    //     new("", "Never"),
    //     new("30", "30 days"),
    //     new("365", "365 days"),
    // ],
    // Hide Optional Fields
    // Hide = ["RestrictTo","Notes"],
});
```

### Admin User API Keys

When the `ApiKeysFeature` plugin is registered, the [User Admin UI](/admin-ui-identity-users) 
will be enhanced to include the ability to create and manage API Keys for the user at the bottom of the **Edit User** form:   

![](/img/pages/auth/apikeys/admin-ui-user-apikeys.png)

#### Creating User API Keys

When creating API Keys, you can assign them a **Name**, its **Expiration** date and any **Scopes**, **Features** and **Notes**.

### Restrict to APIs

`Scopes` provide a simple way to logically group a collection of related APIs behind UX-friendly names without Users 
needing to know the behavior of each individual API. 

In addition, Users who want fine-grained control can also restrict API Keys to only be able to access specific APIs that 
their systems make use of by selecting them from the **Restrict to APIs** option:

![](/img/pages/auth/apikeys/apikeys-restrict-to.png)

#### One Time only access of generated API Key

All UIs limit access to the generated API Key token so that it's only accessible at the time of creation:

![](/img/pages/auth/apikeys/admin-ui-user-apikeys-create-dialog.png)

#### Editing User API Keys

Everything about the API Key can be edited after it's created except for the generated API Key token itself, in addition
to be able to cancel and revoke the API Key:

![](/img/pages/auth/apikeys/admin-ui-user-apikeys-edit.png)

Invalid API Keys that have expired or have been disabled will appear disabled in the UI:

![](/img/pages/auth/apikeys/admin-ui-user-apikeys-disabled.png)

## User Management API Keys

In addition to the built-in Admin UIs to manage API Keys, all Identity Auth Tailwind templates have also been updated
to include support for managing API Keys in their User Account pages:

    </a>
</div>

The templates aren't configured to use API Keys by default, but new projects can be configured to use API Keys by 
selecting the **API Keys** feature on the [Start Page](/start):

[![](/img/pages/auth/apikeys/start-apikeys.png)](/start)

Or by mixing the `apikeys` project in your host project:

:::sh
x mix apikeys
:::

Which add the `Configure.ApiKeys.cs` modular startup to your Host project, which registers the `ApiKeysFeature` plugin
where you'd use the `UserScopes` and `UserFeatures` collections instead to control which scopes and features Users
can assign to their own API Keys, e.g:

```csharp
services.AddPlugin(new ApiKeysFeature {
    // Optional: Available Scopes Admin Users can assign to any API Key
    Features = [
        Features.Paid,
        Features.Tracking,
    ],
    // Optional: Available Features Admin Users can assign to any API Key
    Scopes = [
        Scopes.TodoRead,
        Scopes.TodoWrite,
    ],
    
    // Optional: Limit available Scopes Users can assign to their own API Keys
    UserScopes = [
        Scopes.TodoRead,
    ],
    // Optional: Limit available Features Users can assign to their own API Keys
    UserFeatures = [
        Features.Tracking,
    ],
});
```

### Identity Auth API Keys

When enabled users will be able to create and manage their own API Keys from their Identity UI pages
which will use any configured `UserScopes` and `UserFeatures`:

![](/img/pages/auth/apikeys/identity-auth-apikeys.png)

### Client Usage

Like most API Key implementations, API Keys can be passed in a [HTTP Authorization Bearer Token](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750#section-2.1)
that can be configured in ServiceStack Service Clients with: 

#### C#

```csharp
var client = new JsonApiClient(BaseUrl) {
    BearerToken = apiKey
};
```

#### TypeScript

```ts
const client = new JsonServiceClient(BaseUrl)
client.bearerToken = apiKey
```

### API Key HTTP Header

Alternatively, API Keys can also be passed in the `X-Api-Key` HTTP Header which allows clients to be configured
with an alternative Bearer Token allowing the same client to call both **Authenticated** and **API Key** protected APIs, e.g:

#### C#

```csharp
var client = new JsonApiClient(BaseUrl) {
    BearerToken = jwt,
    Headers = {
        [HttpHeaders.XApiKey] = apiKey
    }
};
```

#### TypeScript

```ts
const client = new JsonServiceClient(BaseUrl)
client.bearerToken = apiKey
client.headers.set('X-Api-Key', apiKey)
```

Or use a different HTTP Header by configuring `ApiKeysFeature.HttpHeader`, e.g:

```csharp
services.AddPlugin(new ApiKeysFeature {
    HttpHeader = "X-Alt-Key"
});
```

## Simple Auth Story

With ServiceStack now fully [integrated with ASP.NET Identity Auth](/auth/identity-auth),
our latest [.NET 8 Tailwind Templates](/start) offer a full-featured Auth Configuration complete with User Registration, 
Login, Password Recovery, Two Factory Auth, and more.

Whilst great for Web Applications that need it, it neglects the class of Apps which don't need User Auth and
the additional complexity it brings inc. Identity and Password Management, EF Migrations, Token Expirations, OAuth Integrations, etc. 

For these stand-alone Apps, Microservices and Docker Appliances that would still like to restrict Access to their APIs
but don't need the complexity of ASP .NET Core's Authentication machinery, a simpler Auth Story would be preferred.

With the introduction of API Keys in this release we're able to provide a simpler Auth Story for .NET 8 Microservices 
that's easy for **Admin** Users to manage and control which trusted clients and B2B Integrations can access their functionality.

:::youtube 0ceU91ZBhTQ
Simple Auth Story with API Keys ideal for .NET 8 Microservices
:::

The easiest way to get started is by creating a new Empty project with API Keys enabled with your preferred database
to store the API Keys in. SQLite is a good choice for stand-alone Apps as it doesn't require any infrastructure dependencies.

<div class="not-prose mx-auto">
  <h3 id="template" class="mb-4 text-4xl tracking-tight font-extrabold text-gray-900">
      Create a new Empty project with API Keys
  </h3>
  <auth-templates></auth-templates>
</div>

### Existing Projects

Existing projects not configured with Authentication can enable this simple Auth configuration by running:

:::sh
x mix apikeys-auth
:::

Which will add the [ServiceStack.Server](https://nuget.org/packages/ServiceStack.Server) dependency and the 
[Modular Startup](/modular-startup) configuration below:

```csharp
public class ConfigureApiKeys : IHostingStartup
{
    public void Configure(IWebHostBuilder builder) => builder
    .ConfigureServices(services =>
    {
        services.AddPlugin(new AuthFeature(new AuthSecretAuthProvider("p@55wOrd")));
        services.AddPlugin(new ApiKeysFeature
        {
            // Optional: Available Scopes Admin Users can assign to any API Key
            // Features = [
            //     "Paid",
            //     "Tracking",
            // ],
            // Optional: Available Features Admin Users can assign to any API Key
            // Scopes = [
            //     "todo:read",
            //     "todo:write",
            // ],
        });
    })
    .ConfigureAppHost(appHost =>
    {
        using var db = appHost.Resolve<IDbConnectionFactory>().Open();
        var feature = appHost.GetPlugin<ApiKeysFeature>();
        feature.InitSchema(db);
    });
}
```

Which configures the **AuthSecretAuthProvider** with the **Admin** password and **ApiKeysFeature** to enable [API Keys](/auth/apikeys) support.

### Admin UI

The **Admin** password will give you access to the [Admin UI](/admin-ui) at:

:::{.text-4xl .text-center .text-indigo-800}
/admin-ui
:::

![](/img/pages/auth/simple/admin-ui-signin.png)

![](/img/pages/auth/simple/admin-ui-dashboard.png)

### API Keys Admin UI

Clicking on **API Keys** menu item will take you to the API Keys Admin UI where you'll be able to create new API Keys 
that you can distribute to different API consumers you want to be able to access your APIs:

![](/img/pages/auth/simple/admin-ui-apikeys.png)

The **ApiKeysFeature** plugin will let you control different parts of the UI, including what **Features** you want to
assign to API Keys and what **Scopes** you want individual API Keys to be able to have access to.

```csharp
services.AddPlugin(new ApiKeysFeature
{
    Features = [
        "Paid",
        "Tracking",
    ],
    Scopes = [
        "todo:read",
        "todo:write",
    ],
    // ExpiresIn =[
    //     new("", "Never"),
    //     new("30", "30 days"),
    //     new("365", "365 days"),
    // ],    
    // Hide = ["RestrictTo","Notes"],
});
```

Any configuration on the plugin will be reflected in the UI:

![](/img/pages/auth/simple/admin-ui-apikeys-new.png)

The API Keys Admin UI also lets you view and manage all API Keys in your App, including the ability to revoke API Keys, 
extend their Expiration date as well as manage any Scopes and Features assigned to API Keys.

![](/img/pages/auth/simple/admin-ui-apikeys-edit.png)

### Protect APIs with API Keys

You'll now be able to protect APIs by annotating Request DTOs with the `[ValidateApiKey]` attribute:

```csharp
[ValidateApiKey]
public class Hello : IGet, IReturn<HelloResponse>
{
    public required string Name { get; set; }
}
```

Which only allows requests with a **valid API Key** to access the Service.

### Scopes

We can further restrict API access by assigning them a scope which will only allow access to Valid API Keys configured 
with that scope, e.g:

```csharp
[ValidateApiKey("todo:read")]
public class QueryTodos : QueryDb<Todo>
{
    public long? Id { get; set; }
    public List<long>? Ids { get; set; }
    public string? TextContains { get; set; }
}

[ValidateApiKey("todo:write")]
public class CreateTodo : ICreateDb<Todo>, IReturn<Todo>
{
    [ValidateNotEmpty]
    public required string Text { get; set; }
    public bool IsFinished { get; set; }
}

[ValidateApiKey("todo:write")]
public class UpdateTodo : IUpdateDb<Todo>, IReturn<Todo>
{
    public long Id { get; set; }
    [ValidateNotEmpty]
    public required string Text { get; set; }
    public bool IsFinished { get; set; }
}

[ValidateApiKey("todo:write")]
public class DeleteTodos : IDeleteDb<Todo>, IReturnVoid
{
    public long? Id { get; set; }
    public List<long>? Ids { get; set; }
}
```

### Restrict To APIs

Scopes allow for coarse-grained access control allowing a single scope to access a logical group of APIs. For more 
fine-grained control you can use **Restrict To APIs** to specify just the APIs an API Key can access:

![](/img/pages/auth/simple/admin-ui-apikeys-restrict-to.png)

Unlike scopes which can access APIs with the **same scope** or **without a scope**, Valid API Keys configured with
**Restrict To APIs** can only access those specific APIs.

### Features

Features are user-defined strings accessible within your Service implementation to provide different behavior
based on Features assigned to the API Key, e.g:

```csharp
public object Any(QueryTodos request)
{
    if (Request.GetApiKey().HasFeature("Paid"))
    {
        //...
    }
}
```

### API Explorer

Support for API Keys is also integrated into the [API Explorer](/api-explorer) allowing
users to use their API Keys to access API Key protected Services which are highlighted with a **Key** Icon:

![](/img/pages/auth/simple/apiexplorer-requires-apikey.png)

Users can enter their API Key by clicking on the **Key** Icon in the top right, or the link in the Warning alert
when trying to access an API Key protected Service:

![](/img/pages/auth/simple/apiexplorer-apikey-dialog.png)

### Summary

We hope this shows how stand-alone .NET 8 Microservices and self-contained Docker Apps can use the 
simple **Admin** and **API Keys** configuration to easily secure their APIs, complete with **Management UI** 
and **typed Service Client** integrations.

## RHEL 9 Default Cryptographic Policy

![](/img/pages/release-notes/v8.3/bg-redhat.webp)

A consequence of RedHat Enterprise Linux 9's hardened 
[system-wide cryptographic policies](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/security_hardening/using-the-system-wide-cryptographic-policies_security-hardening) 
is that it's incompatible with ServiceStack's current licensing mechanism which uses RSA encryption and SHA1 hashing algorithm
to protect and validate license keys.

Unfortunately this means it's not possible to use License Keys to run unrestricted ServiceStack Apps on default 
installs of RHEL 9. The difficulty being we can't both support RHEL 9's hardened cryptography policy and 
maintain compatibility of using newer License Keys in all previous versions of ServiceStack - vital
for enabling frictionless rotation of Keys. 

As a system-wide policy we're unable to work around this restriction in the library to allow usage of RSA+SHA1 to just
validate License Keys (i.e. the only place it's used). As it only affected a small number of users, we initially recommend 
that users just switch to use
[RHEL's Legacy Cryptography Policy](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/security_hardening/using-the-system-wide-cryptographic-policies_security-hardening)
to allow for maximum compatibility with existing software.

### Road to Solution

But as more customers upgraded to RHEL 9 and started experiencing the same issue, we've decided to invest time to 
try and address this issue starting with adding support for a configurable Hashing algorithm when creating and validating
License Keys. We still have the issue of not being able to generate a new License Key that would be compatible with both
default RHEL 9 and all previous versions of ServiceStack.

The solutions under consideration were:
 - Generate a new License Key that's compatible with RHEL 9's hardened cryptography policy, but inform customers that 
they'll be unable to use the new License Key on their existing versions of ServiceStack and to continue to use their 
existing License Key for existing versions
 - Generate 2 License Keys, and explain to Customers which key to use for previous versions of ServiceStack and which key 
to use for RHEL 9 
 - Provide a way for customers to regenerate their License Key to support RHEL 9's hardened cryptography policy

Since this issue only affected a minority of our Customers we decided to go with the last option to avoid inflicting any
additional complexity on the majority of our Customers who are unaffected by this issue.

### Generate License Key for RHEL 9+

Starting from this release Customers can regenerate a new License Key with a stronger **SHA512** Hash Algorithm 
that's compatible with RHEL 9's default hardened cryptography policy by visiting:

:::{.text-3xl .text-indigo-600}
https://account.servicestack.net/regenerate-license
:::

### Future

We'll need to wait at least 1-2 years before we can make the stronger Hash Algorithm the default in order to reduce the
impact of not being able to use new License Keys on versions of ServiceStack prior to **v8.2**.

After the switch is made regenerating license keys will no longer be necessary.

## XSS Vulnerability

This release also fixes a DOM XSS vulnerability reported by René de Sain [@renniepak](https://x.com/renniepak) in ServiceStack's 
built-in Login page in which already authenticated users can be redirected to a page that could invoke a JavaScript function
that could trigger an XSS vulnerability, e.g:

    /login?redirect=javascript:alert(1)
