<h1 class="py-4">100M package downloads 🎉</h1>

Shortly after adding [1st-class net6.0 support](/releases/v5_13), we're starting off **2022** eclipsing an impressive milestone having crossed
[100M+ NuGet package downloads](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/servicestack) which we're celebrating with our first licensing model 
change since our 2014 launch where ServiceStack is now...

<h1 class="text-center py-4">FREE for Individual & OSS projects!</h1>

This is the same perpetual, royalty-free License to use ServiceStack unrestricted as our [Indie Licenses](https://servicestack.net/pricing) (less commercial support). 

OSS Projects have always been able to use the [ServiceStack source code for free](/oss), however collaborative
OSS Projects publicly hosted on **GitHub** or **GitLab** can now generate an OSS License Key for their Project to enable unrestricted
usage of **ServiceStack's official NuGet packages** with a License Key that can be included & shared in their project source code to enable
unrestricted usage for its users.

<a href="https://servicestack.net/free">
    <h3 class="text-center text-3xl mb-3 font-normal">servicestack.net/free</h3>
    <div class="block flex justify-center shadow hover:shadow-lg rounded py-8">
        <img class="" style="width:700px" src="/img/pages/overview/servicestack-free.png">
    </div>
</a>

Both options generates a license key enabling perpetual, unrestricted royalty-free usage of any ServiceStack version released in that year 
(e.g. 2022). ServiceStack libraries never call home, so license verification is completely stand-alone ensuring License Keys will forever 
enable unrestricted perpetual usage of any version of ServiceStack released within the same year the license key was generated. 

These licenses are **gratis**, i.e. **no account or email is required**. ServiceStack v6 is our best release ever that we'd love to see broad
adoption of, so we're removing the cost barrier to entry for Individuals & OSS projects which we hope you'll make use of to create amazing experiences with, e.g. that our new premier <a href="https://jamstacks.net">jamstacks.net</a> project templates can deliver.

We're keen of creating a welcoming space for a dev community of like-minded App creators, which we consider ourselves a part of.

### Community Support

We're happy to continue extending free licenses to individuals & OSS projects indefinitely provided that it doesn't negatively impact our 
development resources currently dedicated on developing ServiceStack, i.e. additional free users shouldn't impose additional burden on the
full-time dev resources currently working on improving ServiceStack.

At the same time we're happy to help in anyway we can to make it easy for the community to help each other so we've created a new
[ServiceStack/Discuss GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/ServiceStack/Discuss/discussions) space where you can request help from the community 
in its **Q&A** category:

</div>

Hopefully it's also something we can also contribute to in our downtime, but our highest priority is going to remain committed to 
supporting commercial customers whose licenses are funding the full-time dev resources supporting and improving ServiceStack.

Free license users who want to report an Issue are welcome to send PR's with either a **reproducible** failing test of the issue or the fix itself.

### Motivation

Our primary goal with ServiceStack is to make the best & most productive App Services Framework available as broadly as possible, which is only achievable with full-time dev resources committed to improving it. With the lack of any cloud or Infrastructure businesses funding development teams behind free quality frameworks, sales of commercial licenses have historically been the only way for this to be sustainable. As a 100% bootstrapped company not beholden to anyone, we've been fortunate to be immediately profitable since our 2014 launch, and every month since where we can now comfortably sacrifice a majority of the Indie Licenses that's contributed to 23% of our overall revenue in exchange for a larger user base that we ultimately believe will benefit the entire ServiceStack community.

If this initiative is successful in significantly increasing adoption without impacting business licenses currently funding development we'll look at further expanding it to cover all Indie License users or adopt something akin to
[Duende's Fair Trade Software License](https://blog.duendesoftware.com/posts/20220111_fair_trade/) in future.

Either way we welcome new ServiceStack developers previously prohibited by cost and hope you create something awesome with it! 🎉

## v6.0.2 Release

This release is essentially a more refined v6 release with a week of fixes of reported issues and another breaking change we thought important to introduce immediately to align with the recommendations for .NET 6+ future releases.

### API Explorer now supports PascalCase

Previously you needed to use ASP.NET Core's default camelCase to use API Explorer & Admin UI, we've now also added support for .NET Framework PascalCase default bringing ServiceStack's exciting new mainstay to more supported platforms.

### HTTP Utils rewritten to use HttpClient in .NET 6+

Our [HTTP Utils](/http-utils) provides user-friendly extension methods for intuitively making HTTP requests from URL strings, e.g:

```csharp
List<GithubRepo> repos = $"https://api.github.com/users/{user}/repos"
    .GetJsonFromUrl()
    .FromJson<List<GithubRepo>>();
```

As .NET's existing `HttpWebRequest` has been officially deprecated, these UX-friendly HTTP APIs were rewritten to use the recommended **HttpClient** implementation in .NET 6+ builds so they can continue to used without concern of relying on deprecated implementations.

All new HttpClient implementations remain in the core **ServiceStack.Text.dll** which continues to remain a **dependency-free** library courtesy of HttpClient being available in default .NET 6 installations.

### New Source Compatible API

Given they're completely different implementations it wasn't possible to enable 100% compatibility with existing code that use custom Request & Response filters
however as we need to use both implementations in the same code-base we've added a source compatible `.With()` APIs you can use instead to customize a HTTP Request, e.g:

```csharp
var response = url.GetJsonFromUrl(requestFilter:req => req.With(c => c.UserAgent = UserAgent));
var response = await url.GetJsonFromUrlAsync(requestFilter:req => req.With(c => c.UserAgent = UserAgent));
```

Which lets you configure a [HttpRequestConfig](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/main/ServiceStack.Text/src/ServiceStack.Text/HttpRequestConfig.cs) that is equally applied to their `HttpClient` and `HttpWebRequest` implementations. 

It also includes `Set*` methods to simplify common tasks like creating Authenticated Requests, e.g:

```csharp
var json = await url.GetJsonFromUrlAsync(requestFilter: req => 
    req.With(c => {
        c.UserAgent = UserAgent;
        c.SetAuthBasic(ClientId, ClientSecret);
    }), token: token).ConfigAwait();
```

The full [HttpRequestConfig](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/main/ServiceStack.Text/src/ServiceStack.Text/HttpRequestConfig.cs) API available in this release include:

```csharp
public class HttpRequestConfig 
{
    public string? Accept { get; set; } 
    public string? UserAgent { get; set; } 
    public string? ContentType { get; set; }
    public string? Referer { get; set; }
    public string? Expect { get; set; }
    public string[]? TransferEncoding { get; set; }
    public bool? TransferEncodingChunked { get; set; }
    public NameValue? Authorization { get; set; }
    public LongRange? Range { get; set; }
    public List<NameValue> Headers { get; set; } = new();

    public void SetAuthBearer(string value) => Authorization = new("Bearer", value);
    public void SetAuthBasic(string name, string value) => 
        Authorization = new("Basic", Convert.ToBase64String(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(name + ":" + value)));
    public void SetRange(long from, long? to = null) => Range = new(from, to);

    public void AddHeader(string name, string value) => Headers.Add(new(name, value));
}
```

#### Inspecting Responses

For source compatible APIs to inspect HTTP Responses you can use `GetHeader()` to retrieve HTTP Response Headers, `GetContentLength()` to retrieve the **Content-Length** if exists and `MatchesContentType()` to compare against existing MimeTypes which ignores whitespace, casing and charset suffixes, e.g:

```csharp
var response = baseUrl.AppendPath("dir","sub").AddQueryParam("id", 1)
    .SendStringToUrl(method: "HEAD",
        responseFilter: res => {
            Assert.That(res.GetHeader("X-Method"), Is.EqualTo("HEAD"));
            Assert.That(res.GetHeader("X-Id"), Is.EqualTo("1"));
            Assert.That(res.MatchesContentType("video/mp4"));
            Assert.That(res.GetContentLength(), Is.EqualTo(100));
        });
```

#### Connect to HttpFactory

The HttpClient HttpUtils use a lazy singleton for efficiency however if you're using it in a host that has an ASP.NET IOC you can configure it to make use of a HttpClient factory by using the `IServiceCollection.AddHttpUtilsClient()` extension method, e.g:

```csharp
public class AppHost : AppHostBase, IHostingStartup
{
    public void Configure(IWebHostBuilder builder) => builder
        .ConfigureServices(services => services.AddHttpUtilsClient())
        .Configure(app => {
            if (!HasInit) 
                app.UseServiceStack(new AppHost());
        });
}
```

#### Custom HttpClient

Alternatively you can configure it to use your own client factory with:

```csharp
HttpUtils.CreateClient = () => UseMyHttpClient()
```

The following Core APIs also have extension methods on `HttpClient` which existing HttpClient instances can make use of:

 - `SendStringToUrl()`
 - `SendStringToUrlAsync()`
 - `SendBytesToUrl()`
 - `SendBytesToUrlAsync()`
 - `SendStreamToUrl()`
 - `SendStreamToUrlAsync()`

### ServiceStack now using HttpClient in .NET 6

A consequence of replacing the existing HTTP Utils `HttpWebRequest` implementations is that internally ServiceStack is now using `HttpClient` throughout its libraries including the [C# Server Events Client](/csharp-server-events-client), [ServiceStack.Stripe](https://github.com/ServiceStack/Stripe), `GitHubGateway`, `AuthHttpGateway`, etc.

### ZLibStream used for deflate compression in .NET 6

Thanks to Eaton from the ServiceStack Community for [reporting issues with DeflateStream](https://forums.servicestack.net/t/v6-compression-question/10334/4) which has been [superseded by `ZLibStream`](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/38022) for deflate compression in .NET 6+.

### /types/js now cached in production

Given the primary usecase for the new [JavaScript Language support](#instant-typed-javascript-dtos-🚀) is to enable instant access to Typed APIs using a `<script>` reference in HTML Pages, it's now cached by default in non **DebugMode** configurations for improved runtime performance.

Should it be needed, uncached JS DTOs can be accessed with `/types/js?cache=false`.

## v5.14 Release

In conjunction with this v6 release we've also shipped v5.14 which is our 
[last release supporting .NET Framework v4.5](/releases/v5_13#v4-5-net-framework-deprecation-notice). 
From **v6+** all ServiceStack packages have been upgraded to use **.NET Framework v4.7.2+** across the board.

## Fast Browsing Mode 

We regret the unnaturally long length of these release notes, and invite you to scan Sidebar links to **fast jump** to interested features ⚡️

## New built-in features

We'll explore each in more detail, but 2 very useful new routes to remember now built into every ServiceStack App are:

<div class="not-prose grid gap-y-4 ">
    <div class="text-center pt-1">
        <h3 class="text-4xl text-indigo-800">/api/{Request}</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600">Pre-defined JSON route to call any API</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-center pb-3">
        <h3 class="text-4xl text-indigo-800">/ui/{Request}</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600">API Explorer Auto UI to call any API</p>
    </div>
</div>


Where Request DTO names can be used to call APIs using API Explorer's Auto UI or at the new `/api` route with any HTTP JSON client.

## API Explorer

We ultimately expect **API Explorer** to be the flagship v6 feature providing the greatest value to all ServiceStack customers since it's a built-in feature yielding immediate utility with a **instant UI to call any API** without any integration or configuration required, i.e. after upgrading to the latest release you can immediately go to **/ui** to browse and call your App's APIs.

### A better Postman and Swagger UI for ServiceStack APIs

Quite simply, even at its v1 release we believe it a better Postman to call your ServiceStack APIs and a better Swagger UI to document them to API consumers, with unparalleled customizability and envious performance. 

For a glimpse of what's in v1, we've prepared a quick tour of its features:

<lite-youtube class="w-full mx-4 my-4" width="560" height="315" videoid="lUDlTMq9DHU" style="background-image: url('https://img.youtube.com/vi/lUDlTMq9DHU/maxresdefault.jpg')"></lite-youtube>

### ServiceStack Exclusive

With greater knowledge about your APIs ServiceStack's able to provide a smarter, richer and more optimized UX than what would be possible had every feature had to be routed through a lowest common denominator specification like [Open API](/openapi), e.g. trying to construct source code in different languages from basic common types ends up inferior to asking ServiceStack directly to translate DTOs in the preferred language, granularity & language features we want, which it creates directly from your DTOs **richer C# blue-print**, i.e. instead of more primitive lossier basic types. As a result API Explorer can include features Swagger UI and Postman can't like **Source code navigation** in all [11 languages supported by Add ServiceStack Reference](https://servicestack.net/service-reference).

<p class="text-center py-4 text-xl">Let's go feature exploring via screenshots 📷</p>

The entire API Explorer UI is driven by the **rich metadata** around your APIs and AppHost's **registered plugins**, e.g. if you have the 
ServiceStack [AuthFeature](/auth/authentication-and-authorization) plugin registered, the home page will display a **Sign In** dialog based on the its **configured Auth Providers**. 

This is what you'll see in a new [Blazor WASM](https://vue-vite-api.jamstacks.net/ui) project which has **Credentials** Auth, **JWT** as well as **Facebook**, **Google** and **Microsoft** OAuth providers registered in [Configure.Auth.cs](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/blazor-wasm/blob/main/MyApp/Configure.Auth.cs)

<a href="https://vue-vite-api.jamstacks.net/ui" class="block my-8 p-4 rounded shadow hover:shadow-lg">
    <img src="/img/pages/apiexplorer/signin.png">
</a>

Custom Auth Providers can provide their own Form Layout by overriding the `FormLayout`, e.g. the above Credentials UI is creatable with:

```csharp
public class CustomCredentialsAuthProvider : CredentialsAuthProvider
{
    public CustomCredentialsAuthProvider()
    {
        FormLayout = new() {
            Input.For<Authenticate>(x => x.UserName, c =>
            {
                c.Label = "Email address";
                c.Required = true;
            }),
            Input.For<Authenticate>(x => x.Password, c =>
            {
                c.Type = "Password";
                c.Required = true;
            }),
            Input.For<Authenticate>(x => x.RememberMe),
        };
    }
    //...
}
```

Where the `Input` utility can be used to configure most HTML Form Input control properties that automatically configures to use the desired Input control for each property Type.

You can Sign In with any of the users in the [Vue Vite Sign In](https://vue-vite.jamstacks.net/signin) page configured in 
[Configure.AuthRepository.cs](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/vue-vite/blob/main/api/MyApp/Configure.AuthRepository.cs), i.e:

| Username           | Password | Role     |
| ------------------ | -------- | -------- |
| admin@email.com    | p@55wOrd | Admin    |
| manager@email.com  | p@55wOrd | Manager  |
| employee@email.com | p@55wOrd | Employee |

If signed in with the **Admin** User and the [Admin Users](/admin-ui-users) plugin is configured:

```csharp
Plugins.Add(new AdminUsersFeature());
```

It also displays **Admin UI** links that only **Admin** Users have access to.

<a href="https://vue-vite-api.jamstacks.net/ui" class="block my-8 p-4 rounded shadow hover:shadow-lg">
    <img src="/img/pages/apiexplorer/admin-user.png">
</a>

::: info
**Admin UI** is a new App but built using the same HTML Modules technology & shares common components with **API Explorer**
:::

If you'd like to, you can add personalized links for users in different roles, e.g. this is what's used to populate the above UI for Admins:

```csharp
appHost.AddToAppMetadata(meta =>
{
    meta.Plugins.Auth.RoleLinks[RoleNames.Admin] = new List<LinkInfo>
    {
        new() { Href = "../admin-ui", Label = "Dashboard", Icon = Svg.ImageSvg(Svg.Create(Svg.Body.Home)) },
        new() { Href = "../admin-ui/users", Label = "Manage Users", Icon = Svg.ImageSvg(Svg.GetImage(Svg.Icons.Users, "currentColor")) },
    };
});
```

Once signed in, API Explorer expands to include all the protected APIs the signed in user has access to, identifiable with the padlock icon.

### API Form

The major tabs takes you to different API feature areas, with the first **API** tab being where to **call APIs** through an **Auto UI** generated based on the **Request DTO** schema. Submitting the form returns API results in a similar layout to Postman with **body** displaying a syntax highlighted JSON response, **Raw** showing raw JSON output in a textarea and the **Preview** tab displaying results in a human-friendly view: 

<a href="https://vue-vite-api.jamstacks.net/ui/QueryBookings?body=preview" class="block my-8 p-4 rounded shadow hover:shadow-lg">
    <img src="/img/pages/apiexplorer/api-form-QueryBookings.png">
</a>

The Auto UI by default uses the appropriate HTML Input UI Control based on each property type:

| UI Input                | Data Types |
| ----------------------- | -------- |
| `<select>`              | Enum, Custom Values |
| `<input type=number>`   | Numeric Types |
| `<input type=date>`     | DateTime, DateTimeOffset, DateOnly |
| `<input type=time>`     | TimeSpan, TimeOnly |
| `<input type=checkbox>` | Boolean |
| `<input type=text>`     | default |


Where the `CreateBooking` Request DTO defined in [Bookings.cs](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/blazor-wasm/blob/main/MyApp.ServiceModel/Bookings.cs):

```csharp
[Tag("bookings"), Description("Create a new Booking")]
[Route("/bookings", "POST")]
[ValidateHasRole("Employee")]
[AutoApply(Behavior.AuditCreate)]
public class CreateBooking : ICreateDb<Booking>, IReturn<IdResponse>
{
    [Description("Name this Booking is for"), ValidateNotEmpty]
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public RoomType RoomType { get; set; }
    [ValidateGreaterThan(0)]
    public int RoomNumber { get; set; }
    [ValidateGreaterThan(0)]
    public decimal Cost { get; set; }
    public DateTime BookingStartDate { get; set; }
    public DateTime? BookingEndDate { get; set; }
    [Input(Type = "textarea")]
    public string? Notes { get; set; }
}
```

Generates the following UI:

<div class="flex justify-center py-8">
    <a href="https://vue-vite-api.jamstacks.net/ui/CreateBooking">
        <img src="/img/pages/apiexplorer/api-form-CreateBooking.png" style="max-width:850px;">
    </a>
</div>

This also shows how we can use the [[Input]](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/src/ServiceStack.Interfaces/InputAttribute.cs) attribute
to further customize the Input UI control for each property as a **declarative alternative** to using `Input.For<T>()` above that the `Notes` property utilizes to change to use a **textarea** control instead.

API Form also supports auto binding [Argument Exceptions](/error-handling) or [Fluent](/validation) & [Declarative](/declarative-validation) Validation rules where any validation errors will be contextually displayed next to the invalid property. Here's both the resulting invalid UI & the Error Response DTO that generated it:

<div class="flex justify-center py-8">
    <a href="https://vue-vite-api.jamstacks.net/ui/CreateBooking">
        <img src="/img/pages/apiexplorer/api-form-CreateBooking-invalid.png" style="max-width:850px;">
    </a>
</div>

Contextual validation errors is used where possible, otherwise an **Error Summary** notification is displayed along with the API Response body containing the full API error information.

Another useful API form feature is being able to call APIs with a **JSON request payload** which maintains a **2-way sync** with the Form's UI allowing you to quickly cycle between input modes to quickly construct your API request.

Real-time JSON validation is also displayed for added assistance, warning you whenever the JSON is malformed.

<div class="flex justify-center py-8">
    <a href="https://vue-vite-api.jamstacks.net/ui/CreateBooking">
        <img src="/img/pages/apiexplorer/api-form-CreateBooking-json.png" style="max-width:850px;">
    </a>
</div>

### API Details

Moving to **Details** tab is the place where API consumers would go to learn about each API where it displays all relevant information about the API at a glance. For `CreateBooking` it shows that:

 - **POST** is the APIs **preferred** HTTP Method 
 - List its **user-defined** and **pre-defined** routes 
 - It's a **protected** API limited to Authenticated Users with the **Employee** role
 - It's categorized in the **bookings** tag group 
 - It's an [AutoQuery CRUD](/autoquery/crud) API implementing `ICreateDb<Booking>` indicating it creates entries in the **Booking** RDBMS Table 
 - It returns an `IdResponse` which we can intuitively infer returns the new Booking **Id** for successfully created Bookings

    <img src="/img/pages/apiexplorer/api-details-CreateBooking.png">
</a>

We'll include the `CreateBooking` DTO again to compare it against the **Required** column used to document the APIs required properties where we can see the only **optional** properties are the **nullable** Value and Reference Types as this Project has `#nullable` enabled. 

```csharp
public class CreateBooking : ICreateDb<Booking>, IReturn<IdResponse>
{
    [Description("Name this Booking is for"), ValidateNotEmpty]
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public RoomType RoomType { get; set; }
    [ValidateGreaterThan(0)]
    public int RoomNumber { get; set; }
    [ValidateGreaterThan(0)]
    public decimal Cost { get; set; }
    public DateTime BookingStartDate { get; set; }
    public DateTime? BookingEndDate { get; set; }
    [Input(Type = "textarea")]
    public string? Notes { get; set; }
}
```

::: info
Importantly **Required** annotations are only documentative, your API still has to validate **required reference types** like `string` using your preferred validation method, e.g. Using the `[ValidateNotEmpty]` declarative attribute, [Fluent Validation](/validation) or manual verification in your Service C# implementation and throwing `ArgumentException` for invalid properties
:::


### Maximum Customizability

Something you don't expect to see in auto generated API docs is the rich custom API Docs that's in the API description which is another example of the high customizability available to enhance API Explorer with custom rich API documentation. 

To become the preferred solution to document APIs, API Explorer was designed from scratch to support multiple customization levels that we've already seen glimpses of in the C# defined Form Layouts, enabling both programmatic and declarative customized Input controls. 

### API Docs Components

We can also further enhance API Explorer with our own custom **HTML Components** by adding them to your Host projects local `/modules` folder which the Blazor WASM project template utilizes to showcase some customization examples:

<ul class="list-none">
    <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/blazor-wasm/tree/main/MyApp/wwwroot/modules" class="font-medium">/modules</a>
        <ul class="list-none">
            <li>
                <span class="font-medium">/ui</span>
                <ul class="list-none">
                    <li>
                        <span class="font-medium">/docs</span>
                        <ul class="list-none">
                            <li>
                                <a href="https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/blazor-wasm/blob/main/MyApp/wwwroot/modules/ui/docs/CreateBookingsDocs.html">
                                    CreateBookingsDocs.html
                                </a>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <a href="https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/blazor-wasm/blob/main/MyApp/wwwroot/modules/ui/docs/TodosDocs.html">
                                    TodosDocs.html
                                </a>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="font-medium">/shared</span>
                <ul class="list-none">
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/blazor-wasm/blob/main/MyApp/wwwroot/modules/shared/Brand.html">
                            Brand.html
                        </a>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

Where you can enhance any of your APIs or DTOs with rich API docs by adding **HTML Components** to `/modules/ui/docs/*.html` which gets included together with API Explorers own components in its single file download. API Explorer is built using [petite-vue](https://github.com/vuejs/petite-vue) which is a **6kb** subset of Vue optimized for progressive enhancement your components can also take advantage of to enhance it with rich dynamic UIs. 

The `*.html` file names aren't important, to create an API doc component it just needs to be named `{Type}Docs`. Here's the simple component example 
[CreateBookingsDocs.html](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/blazor-wasm/blob/main/MyApp/wwwroot/modules/ui/docs/CreateBookingsDocs.html) uses to generate its custom UI that just references the id of its `<template>` UI:

```html
<script>App.components({ CreateBookingDocs: '#create-booking-docs' })</script>
<template id="create-booking-docs">
<div class="text-center my-3">
    <div class="flex justify-center">
        <svg>...</svg>
        <h2 class="text-3xl ml-3 mb-3">Create Bookings API</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="text-gray-500 text-lg">
        <p>
            Create a new room Booking for our {{serviceName}} hotels.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here are some 
            <a class="svg-external text-blue-800" target="_blank" 
                href="https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/scoring-best-hotel-rooms/index.html">
                good tips on making room reservations
            </a>
        </p>
    </div>
</div>
</template>
```

[QueryTodos](https://vue-vite-api.jamstacks.net/ui/QueryTodos?tab=details) is a more advanced example that generates a dynamic UI shared by all TODO APIs:

```html
<script>
(function (){
    let apis = {
        QueryTodos:  'Query Todos, returns all Todos by default',
        CreateTodo:  'Create a Todo',
        UpdateTodo:  'Update a Todo',
        DeleteTodo:  'Delete Todo by Id',
        DeleteTodos: 'Delete multiple Todos by Ids',
    }
    let apiNames = Object.keys(apis)
    function TodosDocs({ op, store, routes, breakpoints }) {
        return {
            $template: '#Todos-docs',
            get op() { return resolve(op) }, 
            routes,
            apis,
            get otherApis() { return apiNames.filter(x => x !== this.op.request.name)
                .reduce((acc,x) => { acc[x] = apis[x]; return acc }, {}) },
        }
    }
    App.components(apiNames.reduce((acc, x) => { acc[x + 'Docs'] = TodosDocs; return acc }, {}))
})() 
</script>
<template id="Todos-docs">
<div class="mx-auto max-w-screen-md text-center py-8">
    <h2 class="text-center text-3xl">{{humanize(op.request.name)}}</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-500 text-lg my-3">{{apis[op.request.name]}}</p>
    <div class="flex justify-center text-left">
        <table>
            <caption class="mt-3 text-lg font-normal">Other Todo APIs</caption>
            <tr v-for="(info,name) in otherApis">
                <th class="text-right font-medium pr-3">
                    <a v-href="{ op:name }" class="text-blue-800">{{humanize(name)}}</a>
                </th>
                <td class="text-gray-500">{{info}}</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </div>
</div>
</template>
```

To generate its reactive **Mini Navigation UI** users can use to cycle through **all TODO API docs** with a `v-href="{ op }"` custom directive:

<a href="https://vue-vite-api.jamstacks.net/ui/QueryTodos?tab=details" class="block my-8 p-4 rounded shadow hover:shadow-lg">
    <img src="/img/pages/apiexplorer/api-details-docs-Todos.png">
</a>

API Doc HTML components are injected with the following properties:

 - `op` - Operation metadata about your API
 - [store](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/src/ServiceStack/modules/ui/js/stores.js) - API Explorer's Reactive object model
 - [routes](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/src/ServiceStack/modules/shared/plugins/usePageRoutes.js) - App `usePageRoutes` plugin Reactive store to manage its SPA routing
 - [breakpoints](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/src/ServiceStack/modules/shared/plugins/useBreakpoints.js) - App `useBreakpoints` plugin Reactive store used that maintains responsive layout breakpoint properties

Components also have access to the entire functionality in the `@servicestack/client` library:

 - [index.d.ts](https://github.com/ServiceStack/servicestack-client/blob/master/src/index.d.ts) - TypeScript library declaration
 - [index.ts](https://github.com/ServiceStack/servicestack-client/blob/master/src/index.ts) - Source code implementation

You're also not limited with what's in API Explorer, with full access to HTML you can also import & use any `<script>` library features.

As we explore differing API Docs requirements we'll document useful functionality available to API doc components, in the meantime you can browse 
[API Explorer's source code](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/tree/master/src/ServiceStack/modules) or 
use JavaScript's reflective capabilities to discover what's available, e.g:

```js
[store,routes,breakpoints].map(Object.keys) // available methods & getters on reactive stores
Object.keys(exports)                        // all imported functionality e.g. @servicestack/client + DTOs
```

### Built-in API Docs

ServiceStack's own built-in APIs uses custom API Doc components itself to document its APIs, e.g. [/ui/docs/RegisterDocs.html](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/src/ServiceStack/modules/ui/docs/RegisterDocs.html) 

```html
<script>App.components({ RegisterDocs:'#register-docs-template' })</script>
<template id="register-docs-template">
<div class="max-w-screen-md mx-auto text-center">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium mb-3">Register API</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-500">
        Public API users can use to create a new User Account, can be added to your AppHost with:
    </p>
    <pre class="my-3"><code v-html="highlight(`Plugins.Add(new RegistrationFeature());`)"></code></pre>
</div>
</template>
```

Generates docs for the built-in **Register** API that includes **C#** Syntax highlighting:

<a href="https://vue-vite-api.jamstacks.net/ui/Register?tab=details" class="block my-8 p-4 rounded shadow hover:shadow-lg">
    <img src="/img/pages/apiexplorer/api-details-docs-Register.png">
</a>

Whilst [/ui/docs/AuthenticateDocs.html](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/src/ServiceStack/modules/ui/docs/AuthenticateDocs.html) demonstrates a more advanced example in generating a responsive dynamic tab layout containing multiple relevant ServiceStack Auth YouTube videos:

<a href="https://vue-vite-api.jamstacks.net/ui/Authenticate?tab=details" class="block my-8 p-4 rounded shadow hover:shadow-lg">
    <img src="/img/pages/apiexplorer/api-details-docs-Authenticate.png">
</a>

### Fantastic Developer Productivity

You'll also be happy to discover the excellent productivity when contributing API Docs when your App is run with `dotnet watch` which takes advantage ASP .NET Core's built-in file watcher to enable an instant **live reload** developer UX.

<div class="flex justify-center py-8">
    <a href="https://youtu.be/lUDlTMq9DHU?t=521">
        <img src="/img/pages/apiexplorer/api-docs-livereload.gif">
    </a>
</div>

Counter intuitively making it more productive than API docs added with C# attributes as changes are immediately visible without a restart.

### Flexible, Productive & Fast

It's worth noting this flexibility doesn't compromise on runtime performance as all HTML components are returned in a single HTTP Cached (ETag) response, returning a pre-computed **Brotli** compressed **.html** file. Another contributing factor to API Explorer's great performance is 
[petite-vue](https://github.com/vuejs/petite-vue) - its **6kb** Vue subset optimized for progressive enhancement promotes optimal HTML practices of defining components in inert [`<templates>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/template) that lazily delays consuming any rendering resources until they're used.

### Overriding built-in components

Customization doesn't end there, you're also able to completely replace **any of API Explorers built-in components** by adding a local file with the same path used in [/ServiceStack/modules](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/tree/master/src/ServiceStack/modules) as Blazor WASM does with its local 
[/modules/shared/Brand.html](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/blazor-wasm/blob/main/MyApp/wwwroot/modules/shared/Brand.html) which overrides the top-right
branding navigation for all API Explorer and Admin UIs:

<div class="flex justify-center py-8">
    <a href="https://vue-vite-api.jamstacks.net/ui/">
        <img src="/img/pages/apiexplorer/brand-blazor-wasm.png" style="max-width:850px;border:1px solid rgb(229 231 235);">
    </a>
</div>

Although a less invasive option if you just want to use your own logo is to configure the `UiFeature` plugin to override the default `BrandIcon` as the other Jamstack templates do in their [Configure.AppHost.cs](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/nextjs/blob/main/api/MyApp/Configure.AppHost.cs):

```csharp
ConfigurePlugin<UiFeature>(feature => {
    feature.Info.BrandIcon.Uri = "/assets/img/logo.svg";
    feature.Info.BrandIcon.Cls = "inline-block w-8 h-8 mr-2";
});
```

<div class="flex justify-center py-8">
    <a href="https://vue-vite-api.jamstacks.net/ui/Register">
        <img src="/img/pages/apiexplorer/brand-vue-ssg.png" style="max-width:850px;border:1px solid rgb(229 231 235);">
    </a>
</div>

### Custom API Form Layouts

In addition to customizing the Input control used for each property, you're also able to redesign the API form itself by specifying your own `FormLayout` to use in `IAppHost.ConfigureOperation<T>()`, e.g. the `RegistrationFeature` does this to mask its password fields:

```csharp
appHost.ConfigureOperation<Register>(op => op.FormLayout = new()
{
    new(){ Input.For<Register>(x => x.DisplayName, x => x.Help = "Your first and last name") },
    new(){ Input.For<Register>(x => x.Email, x => x.Type = Input.Types.Email) },
    new(){ Input.For<Register>(x => x.Password, x => x.Type = Input.Types.Password) },
    new(){ Input.For<Register>(x => x.ConfirmPassword, x => x.Type = Input.Types.Password) },
});
```

Which overrides the default Auto UI Form to use this custom layout:

<div class="flex justify-center py-8">
    <a href="https://vue-vite-api.jamstacks.net/ui/Register">
        <img src="/img/pages/apiexplorer/api-form-Register.png" style="max-width:850px;">
    </a>
</div>

### API Annotations

Whilst the capability of adding rich API Docs is essential when needed, we expect plain C# attributes will often be used to document APIs where `[Description]` can be used to provide a short summary on a **Type** and its **Properties** whilst richer HTML markup can be added to any Type using `[Notes]` 
as done in [Bookings.cs](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/blazor-wasm/blob/main/MyApp.ServiceModel/Bookings.cs):

```csharp
[Tag("bookings"), Description("Find Bookings")]
[Notes("Find out how to quickly create a <a class='svg-external' target='_blank' href='https://youtu.be/rSFiikDjGos'>C# Bookings App from Scratch</a>")]
[Route("/bookings", "GET")]
[Route("/bookings/{Id}", "GET")]
[AutoApply(Behavior.AuditQuery)]
public class QueryBookings : QueryDb<Booking> 
{
    public int? Id { get; set; }
}

[Description("Booking Details")]
[Notes("Captures a Persons Name & Room Booking information")]
public class Booking : AuditBase
{
    [AutoIncrement]
    public int Id { get; set; }
    //...
}
```

Where it still generates very reasonable API documentation displayed in a human-friendly table layout containing properties of its **Request DTO** Type and inherited **base class** properties, starting with the APIs Request DTO followed by all its referenced dependent types - resulting in the details page containing a complete snapshot of all types used in the API:

<a href="https://vue-vite-api.jamstacks.net/ui/QueryBookings?tab=details" class="block my-8 p-4 rounded shadow hover:shadow-lg">
    <img src="/img/pages/apiexplorer/api-details-QueryBookings.png">
</a>

### C# Source Code View

In addition to the human-friendly view, C# devs who prefer it can also click on the **Request DTO** link, its **base class** or **Response** Type to read the API Service contract in its more familiar C# form, where any `[Description]` annotation also filters down into comments:

<a href="https://vue-vite-api.jamstacks.net/ui/QueryBookings?tab=details&detailSrc=QueryBookings&body=preview" class="block my-8 p-4 rounded shadow hover:shadow-lg">
    <img src="/img/pages/apiexplorer/api-details-QueryBookings-code.png">
</a>

### API Code 

The **Code** feature was added in our quest of creating an API Explorer all programmers of different language flavors will love which lets developers choose to browse each API contract in their **preferred programming language** - currently supporting [11 different languages](https://servicestack.net/service-reference).


We've also made it easy to call your APIs from client Apps, all done the same way for each language, distilled into 3 simple steps:

 1. Copy your API DTOs
 2. Copy and install the package containing ServiceStack's generic JSON Service Client
 3. Copy the initial source code pre-configured to call the API they want

At which point, **without any code-gen or build tools**, they'll end up with an **end-to-end Typed API** configured to your APIs endpoint. E.g. this is what it looks like to **Python** developers utilizing our [most recently supported language](/releases/v5_12):

<a href="https://vue-vite-api.jamstacks.net/ui/QueryBookings?tab=code&lang=python" class="block my-8 p-4 rounded shadow hover:shadow-lg">
    <img src="/img/pages/apiexplorer/api-code-QueryBookings-python.png">
</a>

That they can follow to quickly incorporate your API into their existing Apps, in addition **Python**, **C#** or **F#** developers could also copy this source code to their [Jupyter Notebooks](/jupyter-notebooks) for an instant typed visual REPL to explore your APIs in their preferred programming language.

### Responsive Design

You'll be pleased to learn API Explorer also works great in Smart Phones and Tablets letting you comfortably browse and call APIs on the go, it also means new APIs you check-in late Friday afternoon can be instantly usable by relevant stakeholders on the weekend 🚀

<div class="bg-gray-200 flex justify-center py-8">
    <img src="/img/pages/apiexplorer/api-explorer.gif" style="width:500px; border-left:1px solid #CACACA;border-bottom:1px solid #CACACA;">
</div>

## Admin UI

We didn't have any intention of doing it in this release, but as the new **Html Modules** technology we created to build API Explorer accidentally became the most productive & enjoyable development workflow we've experienced, we were excited to start re-implementing [ServiceStack Studio](/studio) features over in it. 

Firstly in order to be able to access Admin functionality we need to enable the relevant protected APIs on our server, currently **Admin UI** only contains the UI for the [Admin Users Feature](/admin-ui-users) that can be enabled with:

```csharp
Plugins.Add(new AdminUsersFeature());
```

Now after a restart you'll get an instant UI **Admin** users can use to perform Admin tasks and access protected information at:

<a href="https://razor-pages.web-templates.io/admin-ui">
    <h3 class="text-center font-medium text-3xl mb-3">/admin-ui</h3>
    <div class="block p-4 rounded shadow hover:shadow-lg">
        <img src="/img/pages/admin-ui/dashboard.png">
    </div>
</a>

For this v1 release, **Dashboard** only shows overall stats about your APIs that **Admin** users can click to navigate between **/ui** and **/admin-ui**

Please let us know what relevant stats of your running App and its APIs you would like to see added first 💡

When the plugin is registered, a link to **Manage Users** will appear in the Sidebar Navigation, Admin UI Home page and role links for the **Admin** users role in API Explorer.

As it shares the same backend configuration and `AdminUsersFeature` functionality, it's ultimately just an alternative UI implementation of the User Admin feature in [ServiceStack Studio](/studio-users) and [Blazor WASM Admin Users](https://vue-vite-api.jamstacks.net/admin-ui/users), re-implemented in **petite-vue** and **tailwindcss** instead of Blazor WASM and Bootstrap. 

The new implementation does gain a few new tricks courtesy of the UI customizability features in this release. By default the Add and Edit Users forms contains the default layout of common properties in [UserAuth.cs](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/src/ServiceStack/Auth/UserAuth.cs)

        <img src="/img/pages/admin-ui/users-edit-default.png" style="max-width:800px;">
    </a>
</div>

But most Apps will likely prefer their to manage their own alternative custom `AppUser` data model properties. This can be customized when registering the `AdminUsersFeature` plugin, e.g. Blazor WASM uses this custom configuration to show alternative form layout and properties in its custom [AppUser](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/blazor-wasm/blob/main/MyApp/Configure.AuthRepository.cs) model:

```csharp
Plugins.Add(new AdminUsersFeature {
    
    // Show custom fields in Search Results
    QueryUserAuthProperties = new() {
        nameof(AppUser.Id),
        nameof(AppUser.Email),
        nameof(AppUser.DisplayName),
        nameof(AppUser.Department),
        nameof(AppUser.CreatedDate),
        nameof(AppUser.LastLoginDate),
    },

    // Specify which fields should be displayed and different responsive breakpoints
    QueryMediaRules = new()
    {
        MediaRules.ExtraSmall.Show<AppUser>(x => new { x.Id, x.Email, x.DisplayName }),
        MediaRules.Small.Show<AppUser>(x => x.Department),
    },

    // Add Custom Fields to Create/Edit User Forms
    UserFormLayout = new() {
        new()
        {
            Input.For<AppUser>(x => x.Email),
        },
        new()
        {
            Input.For<AppUser>(x => x.DisplayName),
        },
        new()
        {
            Input.For<AppUser>(x => x.Company),
            Input.For<AppUser>(x => x.Department),
        },
        new() {
            Input.For<AppUser>(x => x.PhoneNumber, c => c.Type = Input.Types.Tel)
        },
        new() {
            Input.For<AppUser>(x => x.Nickname, c => {
                c.Help = "Public alias (3-12 lower alpha numeric chars)";
                c.Pattern = "^[a-z][a-z0-9_.-]{3,12}$";
                c.Required = true;
            })
        },
        new() {
            Input.For<AppUser>(x => x.ProfileUrl, c => c.Type = Input.Types.Url)
        },
        new() {
            Input.For<AppUser>(x => x.IsArchived), Input.For<AppUser>(x => x.ArchivedDate),
        },
    }
});
```

Where it will display our custom Form Layout in both **New User** and **Edit User** UI Forms:

<div class="flex justify-center py-8">
    <a href="https://razor-pages.web-templates.io/admin-ui/users?edit=2">
        <img src="/img/pages/admin-ui/users-edit-custom.png" style="max-width:800px;">
    </a>
</div>

You can also use `QueryUserAuthProperties` to specify which columns to display in the results view, whilst `QueryMediaRules` can be used to control which columns start appearing at different responsive UI breakpoints for an optimized layout in smaller devices.

### Roadmap

Our immediate goals after this release is to port the remaining ServiceStack Studio features so that **/admin-ui** becomes the one-stop shop for all Admin UI functionality shipped in ServiceStack. At which point we'll be retiring the ServiceStack Studio Desktop App since having them in **Admin UI** results greater utility, a faster UI and a much more productive dev model.

## HTML Modules

HTML Modules is our accidental super productive UI framework powering **API Explorer** and **Admin UI**. Whilst technically at a robust v1 implementation, it requires a significant documentation effort for it to be more widely useful that we're unable to fit in this release. 

We'll provide a brief overview of it should it also be of interest and share some learnings on the elements that help make it so productive.

For a good quick overview, you can browse [ServiceStack/modules](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/tree/master/src/ServiceStack/modules) containing the source code of **API Explorer** and **Admin UI**.

### Back to basics

The overall goal of HTML Modules is effectively to enhance vanilla web development by removing any build steps or obstructions slowing down development. 
Unfortunately the biggest productivity killer we've found when developing UIs was **rebuilding and restarting** .NET projects. Web UI development greatly benefits from fast, iterative instant UI updates that's unfortunately unproductive in C#, so during normal development HTML Modules doesn't make use of any .NET features requiring a restart, leaving `dotnet watch` rebuilds limited to back-end C# API changes.

HTML Modules optimizes for the 3 different modes in the typical web development lifecycle:

### Authoring

It allows developer to maintain source code in an optimal form where they're able to modularize features down into multiple isolated HTML Components and take advantage of rich static analysis and intelli-sense in IDEs by allowing for native JS imports to npm packages, typescript declarations or symbols defined in other **.js** files, e.g:

```ts
import { leftPart } from "@servicestack/client"
import { APP, Authenticate } from "../../lib/types"
import { setBodyClass } from "../../shared/js/core"
```

This does mean we need some instructions to turn our optimal developer source code into source code our browser can run natively which is done through custom processing instructions. A mistake we made in [#Script Pages](https://sharpscript.net/docs/script-pages) was using a custom Handlebars template syntax which resulted in a detracted UX from poor syntax highlighting as it wasn't understood natively by IDEs. 

For HTML Components, all processing instructions are in HTML, JS or CSS comments, e.g. here's API Explorer instructions importing its HTML components:

```html
<!--shared:Alert,AuthNav,Brand,CloseButton,CopyIcon,CopyLine,Image,Input,Loading,PreviewObject,SignIn,ErrorSummary-->
<!--files:components/*.html-->
<!--files:docs/*.html-->
```

Where it hand-picks the Shared components to include, then includes all its local HTML & API Docs components, the wildcard import is why API Docs are instantly visible as they're added, as they're automatically included in the pages next reload.

### Debug

No opinionated functionality is baked into HTML Modules itself, it's essentially a library for defining your own **processing instructions**. It does have pre-defined defaults for its built-in features - that are easily be replaced or removed.

E.g. to process the above instructions, it uses the 
[FilesHandler.cs](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/src/ServiceStack/HtmlModules/FilesHandler.cs) and 
[SharedFolder.cs](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/src/ServiceStack/HtmlModules/SharedFolder.cs) handlers: 

```csharp
public List<IHtmlModulesHandler> Handlers { get; set; } = new()
{
    new SharedFolder("shared", "/modules/shared", ".html"),
    new FilesHandler("files"),
};
```

To be able to run in most browsers, we also need to remove all `import` and `export` declarations. 
Whilst we're at it, lets also support removing debug source code (ala `[Conditional]`) HTML, JS & CSS comments and any empty new lines:

```csharp
public static List<HtmlModuleLine> HtmlLineTransformers { get; } = new()
{
    // Enable static typing during dev, strip from browser to run
    new RemoveLineStartingWith(new[]{ "import ", "declare " }, ignoreWhiteSpace:false, Run.Always), 
    new RemovePrefixesFromLine("export ", ignoreWhiteSpace:false, Run.Always), 
    // Strip debug source code from production
    new RemoveLineEndingWith(new[]{ "/*debug*/", "<!--debug-->" }, ignoreWhiteSpace:true, Run.IgnoreInDebug),
    // Hide dev comments from browser
    new RemoveLineStartingWith("<!---:", ignoreWhiteSpace:true, Run.Always),
    new RemoveLineStartingWith("/**:", ignoreWhiteSpace:true, behaviour:Run.Always),
    // Remove inert empty lines
    new RemoveLineWithOnlyWhitespace(Run.Always),
};
```

To improve performance, all [line processing instructions](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/src/ServiceStack/HtmlModules/HtmlModuleLine.cs) are performed in a single pass and utilize [Span Types](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2018/january/csharp-all-about-span-exploring-a-new-net-mainstay) for minimal allocations.

### Runtime

Each declarative instruction also specifies when it's run, so only the appropriate instructions are run in **debug** and **production** outputs.

As efficient outputs are important for end-user UX, there's also pre-registered Minification blocks:

```csharp
["html"] = new FileTransformerOptions
{
    BlockTransformers = {
        new RawBlock("<!--raw-->", "<!--/raw-->", Run.Always),
        new MinifyBlock("<!--minify-->", "<!--/minify-->", Minifiers.HtmlAdvanced, Run.IgnoreInDebug),
        new MinifyBlock("<script minify>", "</script>", Minifiers.JavaScript, Run.IgnoreInDebug) {
            LineTransformers = FilesTransformer.JsLineTransformers.ToList(),
            Convert = js => "<script>" + js + "</script>",
        },
        new MinifyBlock("<style minify>", "</style>", Minifiers.Css, Run.IgnoreInDebug) {
            Convert = css => "<style>" + css + "</style>"
        }
    }
}
```

Which you can sprinkle in your .html to minify source code and reduce file size to eek out a bit more performance:

```html
<!--raw-->
    Ignore all other processing instructions and emit as-is
<!--/raw-->
<script minify>
    /* Minify .js in non debug requests */
</script>
<style minify>
    /* Minify .css in non debug requests */
</style>
```

By default, it uses lightweight **JSMin** and **CSSMin** built into **ServiceStack.dll**, for more advanced minification you can also 
[mix in NUglify](/mix-tool#mix-in-nuglify).

These instructions are only run once in production builds. By default, it returns a pre-computed compressed response (typically **Brotli**) for most browsers as well as making use of **ETag** HTTP Caching to eliminate unnecessary requests & responses.

### HtmlModules Overview

There's more features & functionality, but this is a good overview of its goals and how **HtmlModules** works. You can experience its dev UX now by adding 
[API Doc components](#api-docs-components) to your local ServiceStack project or by modifying the [existing API Doc Components](#fantastic-developer-productivity) in a new blazor-wasm.web-templates.io Project template.

## Developer productivity tips

Some other generic features and tools we've found to help improve productivity of any project include:

### Tailwind

We wanted to give a special shoutout to [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com) whose thoughtful constraints, intuitive classes, excellent docs, premium components & utility classes dev model resulted in the most productive css framework we've had the pleasure of using.

We want to highlight, Tailwind isn't just limited to npm projects as all projects can make use of its global **tailwindcss** CLI tool to set up a watched **.css** builds for their project as detailed in their [Installation Guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation).

### JSONP

Whilst an old technique, JSONP allows you to perform synchronous I/O operations to force exactly when client App state needs to be available. API Explorer uses this technique to load the API Metadata required to initialize its PetiteVue App and Reactive stores. JSONP also makes it possible to eagerly determine the current authenticated user info. 

This prevents **UI Yank** when displaying multiple Auth states which would've otherwise created jarring UI updates had it waited until the page is loaded before performing the async API Ajax request to fetch the authenticated user information.

```html
<script>
function loadApp(app) { window.APP = app }
function loadAuth(auth) { window.AUTH = auth.responseStatus ? null : auth }
</script>
<script src="/metadata/app?callback=loadApp"></script>
<script src="/auth?callback=loadAuth"></script>
```

JSONP is supported by default in all ServiceStack APIs by specifying the callback function in the `?callback` parameter. A change in v6 making JSONP more useful is that callbacks are also **invoked for Error Responses** with the APIs Error Response DTO that your callback can check to see if its `ResponseStatus` property is populated to determine if a user is authenticated or not.

## Instant Typed JavaScript DTOs 🚀

Ultimately the key to maximizing productivity is avoiding things that interrupt your dev workflow. Since we use `JsonServiceClient` for all API requests one area we were still interrupted by was regenerating TypeScript `dtos.ts` after adding new APIs, as it was the only way to generate typed DTOs for use in the generic `JsonServiceClient` in both Vanilla JS and TypeScript Apps.

For Vanilla JS Apps typically this means running the [x dotnet tool](/typescript-add-servicestack-reference#simple-command-line-utilities-for-typescript) to update `dtos.ts`, then using TypeScript to compile it to JavaScript:

```bash
$ x ts && tsc dtos.ts 
```

While not a great hindrance, it would frequently interrupt our workflow when developing new APIs. 

We're happy to announce this is now optional with the new **native JavaScript Language** support where you can now reference Typed JavaScript DTOs directly from **/types/js**

Since importing JavaScript doesn't require any tooling or build steps, it greatly simplifies calling ServiceStack APIs from **Vanilla JS** Apps which all our [.NET 6 Empty Project Templates](https://servicestack.net/start) now take advantage of for its now optimal friction-less dev model.

To make typed API Requests from web pages, you need only include `/js/require.js` containing a simple `require()` to load **CommonJS** libraries, `/js/servicestack-client.js` (production build of [@servicestack/client](https://github.com/ServiceStack/servicestack-client)) and `/types/js` containing your APIs typed JS DTOs - all built-in ServiceStack. 

After which you'll have access to full feature-set of the generic `JsonServiceClient` with your APIs Typed Request DTOs, e.g:

```html
<script src="/js/require.js"></script>
<script src="/js/servicestack-client.js"></script>
<script src="/types/js"></script>

<script>
var { JsonServiceClient, Hello } = exports

var client = new JsonServiceClient()
client.api(new Hello({ name }))
    .then(api => console.log(api.response))
</script>    
```

Using **/types/js** has the same behavior as using `dtos.js` generated from `$ tsc dtos.ts` whose outputs are identical, i.e. both containing your API DTOs generated in CommonJS format. It's feasible to simulate the TypeScript compiler's output in this instance as ServiceStack only needs to generate DTO Types and Enums to enable its end-to-end API, and not any other of TypeScript's vast featureset.

### Enhanced Dev Time productivity with TypeScript

Even when no longer using TypeScript DTOs in your Apps, it's still useful to have TypeScript's `dtos.ts` included in your project (inc. Vanilla JS projects) to serve as optional type annotations enabling rich intelli-sense and static analysis in IDEs that support it, but as it's no longer used at runtime you're free to generate it at optimal times that don't interrupt your dev workflow.

The other flagship feature we're excited to announce in this release are ServiceStack's new Jamstack templates encapsulating the latest technologies at the forefront of modern web development to deliver both a great **developer experience** and **performant** end-user UX.

[Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/what-is-jamstack) (**J**avaScript, **A**PIs, and **M**arkup) is a modern architecture pattern to build fast, secure and easy to scale web applications where pre-rendering content, enhancing with JavaScript and leveraging CDN static hosting results in a highly productive, flexible and performant system that takes advantage of CDN edge caches to deliver **greater performance** & efficiency at **lower cost**. 

### Jamstack Benefits

It's quickly becoming the preferred architecture for modern web apps with 
[benefits](https://jamstack.org/why-jamstack/) extending beyond performance to improved: 

 - **Security** from a reduced attack surface from hosting read-only static resources and requiring fewer App Servers
 - **Scale** with non-essential load removed from App Servers to CDN's architecture capable of incredible scale & load capacity
 - **Maintainability** resulting from reduced hosting complexity and the clean decoupling of UI and server logic
 - **Portability** with your static UI assets being easily capable from being deployed and generically hosted from any CDN or web server
 - **Developer Experience** with major JavaScript Frameworks embracing Jamstack in their dev model, libraries & tooling  

Ultimately, it's hosting your App's pre-rendered static UI assets on Content Delivery Network (CDN) edge caches close to users locations that's primarily responsible for its lightning performance.

### $0.40 /month

Other by-products of generating pre-computed CDN hostable assets, is interchangeable cost-effective hosting and great SEO - characteristics our Jamstack Demos take advantage of with free **UI** hosting on GitHub Pages CDN leaving their only cost to host its **.NET 6 API** back-ends, deployed with SSH in Docker compose containers to a vanilla [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com) droplet costing only **[$0.40 /month each](https://vue-ssg.jamstacks.net/hosting)**.

### Recommended Templates

These new templates represent the best-in class experiences for their respective **React**, **Vue** & **Blazor WASM** ecosystems each, packed with features & examples common in many websites including Integrated Auth, rich Markdown content as well as TODOs MVC and CRUD examples with built-in contextual validation binding. As such they're **now recommended** over our existing SPA and C# MVC Templates.

We've put together a quick check list to help decide which templates we'd recommend:

| Project     | Recommendation                                                                  |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Next.js     | If you prefer React                                                             |
| Vue SSG     | If you prefer Vue and SEO is important                                          |
| Vue SPA     | If you prefer Vue and happy to trade SEO benefits of SSG for a simpler template |
| Blazor WASM | If you prefer a full C# Stack or are developing Line of Business (LOB) Apps     |

Still not sure? familiarize yourself with their respective dev models by comparing their functionality equivalent TODOs MVC Examples:

### TODOs MVC

<jamstack-todos class="not-prose my-8 pb-8"></jamstack-todos>

All projects utilize the same back-end ServiceStack Services with **TODOs MVC** implemented in
[TodosServices.cs](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/blazor-wasm/blob/main/MyApp.ServiceInterface/TodosServices.cs).


As **Bookings CRUD** is an [AutoQuery CRUD](/autoquery/crud) API, it defines [all its functionality](/autoquery/crud-bookings) in its declarative
[Bookings.cs](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/blazor-wasm/blob/main/MyApp.ServiceModel/Bookings.cs) DTOs and serves as a good example for the minimal dev model effort required to implement a typical Authenticated CRUD UI in each framework:

<jamstack-templates class="not-prose pb-8"></jamstack-templates>

::: info
An updated list of available Jamstack project templates is also at https://jamstacks.net (built with Razor SSG)
:::

### Pre-configured Jamstack App Deployments

All project templates supports CDN hostable UI assets and include the [necessary GitHub Actions](https://vue-ssg.jamstacks.net/posts/deploy) that takes care of building and SSH deploying a Docker compose production build of your App to any Linux Host with just a few GitHub Action Secrets in your GitHub repo. 

The optional `DEPLOY_CDN` secret lets you control whether to deploy your App's static `/wwwroot` assets to your GitHub Pages CDN by specifying the custom domain to use and is what all JamStack Live demos used to deploy a copy of their UIs to GitHub Pages CDN:

| Project Source | GitHub Pages CDN | Digital Ocean Docker .NET API |
| -              | - | - |
| [nextjs](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/nextjs) | nextjs.jamstacks.net | nextjs-api.jamstacks.net |
| [vue-ssg](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/vue-ssg) | vue-ssg.jamstacks.net | vue-ssg-api.jamstacks.net |
| [vue-spa](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/vue-spa) | vue-spa.jamstacks.net | vue-spa-api.jamstacks.net |
| [blazor-wasm](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/blazor-wasm) | blazor-wasm.web-templates.io | blazor-wasm.web-templates.io |

## Blazor WebAssembly

Our new [Blazor WebAssembly (WASM)](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/blazor-wasm) template offers a pure end-to-end integrated C# solution to building a high performance web application with [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) and ServiceStack. In fact we were so impressed by the integrated dev model we've been able to achieve in Blazor that it's become **our preferred technology** to use to develop **Line of Business Apps** since it's the only C# Razor solution adopting our preferred [API First Development](/api-first-development) model with Web UIs reusing the same well-defined APIs as Mobile and Desktop Apps.

### Great Perceived Performance and SEO

Typically the **large download sizes** & slow initial load times of Blazor WASM Apps would make it a poor choice for Internet hosted sites. However, our Blazor WASM template has largely mitigated this with easily maintainable built-in pre-rendering techniques to make every page appear to load quickly, including **instant loading** of its Markdown Pages courtesy of the GitHub Actions publish task generating & deploying pre-rendered content pages.

<p class="pt-3 text-center">You can see the results of this in its live demo when loading the home page, which only has a slight delay:</p>

</a>

### ServiceStack.Blazor

The new **ServiceStack.Blazor** library contains integrated functionality for Blazor including an optimal JSON API HttpClient Factory, API-enabled base components, HTML Utils and Bootstrap & Tailwind UI Input components heavily utilized throughout the template.

### Built-in Blazor and Tailwind UI Components

The Built-in UI Components enable a clean & productive dev model and share the same base classes making them functionally equivalent and can easily be swapped when switching CSS frameworks by updating its namespace in your projects `_Imports.razor`

The Blazor Components in **ServiceStack.Blazor** v1 include:

| Component | Description |
| -                 | - |
| `<TextInput>`     | Text Input control for string properties |
| `<DateTimeInput>` | Date Input control for Date properties |
| `<CheckboxInput>` | Checkbox Input control for Boolean properties |
| `<SelectInput>`   | Select Dropdown for properties with finite list of values like Enums |
| `<TextAreaInput>` | Text Input control for large strings |
| `<DynamicInput>`  | Dynamic component utilizing the appropriate above Input controls in Auto Forms |
| `<AlertSuccess>`  | Displaying successful notification feedback |
| `<ErrorSummary>`  | Displaying error summary message when no contextual field validation is available |

::: info
All Input controls support contextual validation of ServiceStack's existing [structured Error responses](/error-handling)
:::

### Themable

Should it be needed, **all components are themable** by running the included [README.ss](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/blazor-wasm/blob/main/MyApp.Client/Shared/Components/README.ss) executable documentation that copies its **Razor** UI markup locally into your project enabling complete customization of their **Entire UI**.

### Developer Productivity Preview

We're particularly excited about the level of integration & clean productive dev model we've been able to achieve. With ServiceStack's [clean separation](/physical-project-structure) of ServiceStack's **ServiceModel**, combined with Blazor enabling C# on the client, we get **complete reuse** of your APIs shared DTOs as-is to enable an end-to-end Typed API automatically **without any tooling or code-gen**. 

Building on this, the new C# Service Client `Api*` methods make calling remote ServiceStack APIs even **easier than calling a C# method** as its returned `ApiResult<Response>` encapsulates both a typed **Error** & API **Response** to **eliminate Exception handling** as all components can bind directly to its `api.Error`.

The reusability extends to your APIs typed Request DTOs which components can directly **2-way** data bind to, together this allows us to achieve the **ultimate dev model** most LOB UIs can use to implement the same declarative pattern using only an APIs existing Typed DTOs.

For a preview of what this looks like in action, here's the [BookingsCrud/Create.razor](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/tests/ServiceStack.Blazor.Tests/Client/Pages/BookingsCrud/Create.razor) used to Create Bookings:

```html
@attribute [Authorize(Roles="Employee")]
@inherits AppAuthComponentBase

<form @onsubmit="_ => OnSubmit()" @onsubmit:preventDefault 
     class=@CssUtils.ClassNames("relative shadow rounded p-4",@class)>
<CascadingValue Value=@api.Error>
    <button type="button" class="close" @onclick="close"><i></i></button>

    <h1 class="fs-4 text-secondary text-center">

    </div>

    <div class="mb-3 form-floating">
        <SelectInput @bind-Value="request.RoomType" Options=@(Enum.GetValues<RoomType>()) />

        <div class="mb-3 flex-fill form-floating me-1">
            <DateTimeInput @bind-Value="request.BookingStartDate" required />
        </div>

        <div class="mb-3 flex-fill form-floating">
            <DateTimeInput @bind-Value="request.BookingEndDate" />

    <div class="d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center">
        <div>
            <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Create Booking</button>
        </div>
    </div>
</CascadingValue>
</form>

@code {
    [Parameter] public EventCallback<IdResponse> done { get; set; }
    [Parameter] public string? @class { get; set; }

    CreateBooking request = new()
    {
        BookingStartDate = DateTime.UtcNow,
    };

    string[] VisibleFields => new[]{
        nameof(request.Name), nameof(request.RoomType), nameof(request.RoomNumber), nameof(request.BookingStartDate),
        nameof(request.BookingEndDate), nameof(request.Cost), nameof(request.Notes),
    };

    ApiResult<IdResponse> api = new();

    async Task OnSubmit()
    {
        api = await ApiAsync(request);

        if (api.Succeeded)
        {
            await done.InvokeAsync(api.Response!);
            request = new();
        }
    }

    async Task close() => await done.InvokeAsync(null);
}
```

Which binds directly to the [CreateBooking](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/blazor-wasm/blob/main/MyApp.ServiceModel/Bookings.cs) Request DTO:

```csharp
[Tag("bookings"), Description("Create a new Booking")]
[Route("/bookings", "POST")]
[ValidateHasRole("Employee")]
[AutoApply(Behavior.AuditCreate)]
public class CreateBooking : ICreateDb<Booking>, IReturn<IdResponse>
{
    [Description("Name this Booking is for"), ValidateNotEmpty]
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public RoomType RoomType { get; set; }
    [ValidateGreaterThan(0)]
    public int RoomNumber { get; set; }
    [ValidateGreaterThan(0)]
    public decimal Cost { get; set; }
    public DateTime BookingStartDate { get; set; }
    public DateTime? BookingEndDate { get; set; }
    [Input(Type = "textarea")]
    public string? Notes { get; set; }
}
```

To initially render this form:

<a class="flex flex-col justify-center items-center my-8" href="https://vue-vite.jamstacks.net/bookings-crud">
    <img src="/img/pages/jamstack/blazor-wasm/booking-new.png" class="max-w-screen-md">
</a>

Whose `[ValidateNotEmpty]` [declarative validator](/declarative-validation) even filters down to the **client Input** UI to prevent unnecessary invalid API requests:

<a class="flex flex-col justify-center items-center my-8" href="https://vue-vite.jamstacks.net/bookings-crud">
    <img src="/img/pages/jamstack/blazor-wasm/booking-new-validation-client.png" class="max-w-screen-md">
</a>

And what contextual validation of server error responses looks like:

<a class="flex flex-col justify-center items-center my-8" href="https://vue-vite.jamstacks.net/bookings-crud">
    <img src="/img/pages/jamstack/blazor-wasm/booking-new-validation-server.png" class="max-w-screen-md">
</a>

#### Clean Dev Model

Some other things to note is that it just uses the standard `<form>` element given its clean dev model doesn't require any magic behavior, as `api.Error` responses can be passed directly to each control or in this case uses Blazor's built-in `<CascadingValue Value=@api.Error>` to cascade it to child components controls that can make use of it.

#### Integrated Auth

It uses the templates included [AppComponentBase](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/blazor-wasm/blob/main/MyApp.Client/AppComponentBase.cs) which integrates with Blazor's Auth model allowing it to use its standard `[Authorize(Roles="Employee")]` attributes and provides easy access to the Authenticated User's info populated from Secure; HttpOnly JWT Cookies for secure stateless client Authentication that works across App deployments and without any server infrastructure.

Public pages can inherit `AppComponentBase` to access ServiceStack.Blazor's [BlazorComponentBase](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/src/ServiceStack.Blazor/BlazorComponentBase.cs) and get access to `JsonApiClient` dependency and related functionality.

#### AutoQuery CRUD Example

Incidentally, whilst not affecting the above dev model, as `CreateBooking` is an [AutoQuery CRUD](/autoquery/crud) Request DTO, it works without a server implementation as it uses the default (and [overridable](/autoquery/crud#custom-autoquery-crud-services)) implementation generated by AutoQuery.

## Next.js

For those preferring working with **React**, there's a clear choice in Nextjs.org - currently the flagship & [most popular Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/generators/) framework backed by the folks over at [Vercel](https://vercel.com), where it enjoys deep engineering talent committed to maintaining and continually improving it, so you can be confident in the longevity of the technology and the React framework maintained by [Meta](https://meta.com) (Facebook).

<a href="https://nextjs.jamstacks.net" title="nextjs.jamstacks.net"><img src="/img/pages/jamstack/next-black.svg" class="mx-auto block" /></a>

Designed as an SSG framework from the start, its pre-defined patterns include static generation and UX focused functionality built-in. 

### Stale While Revalidate

Its [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app) Data Fetching React Hooks library is one innovative example utilizing the popular 
[stale-while-revalidate](https://web.dev/stale-while-revalidate/) UX pattern to help developers balance 
between **immediacy** — loading cached content right away — and **freshness** — ensuring updates to the cached content are used in the future.

To take advantage of this, the [nextjs](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/nextjs) template includes a `swrClient` that provides a typed wrapper for making typed SWR API Requests with ServiceStack's generic [JsonServiceClient](/typescript-add-servicestack-reference):

```tsx
import { swrClient } from "../lib/gateway"
import { Hello } from "../lib/dtos"

const HelloApi = ({ name }) => {
  const {data, error} = swrClient.get(() => 
    new Hello({ name }))
  if (error) return <div>{error.message}</div>
  return <div>{data?data.result:'loading...'}</div>
}
```

This reactively sets up the UI to handle multiple states:
 - `loading` - displays **loading...** message whilst API request is in transit
 - `data` - when completed, populated with a `HelloResponse` and displayed
 - `error` - when failed, populated with `ResponseStatus` and displayed

The primary UX benefits are realized when re-making an existing request in which a locally-cached *stale* version
is **immediately** returned and displayed whilst a new API Request is made behind the scenes, updating the UI if the fresh response was modified.

Despite Vercel's full-time resources, Next.js is still reliant on the Webpack ecosystem, who although have done a formidable job managing complex tooling requirements for npm projects over a number of years, has since lost the Developer Experience (DX) crown to [vitejs.dev](https://vitejs.dev)

Vite is being [built for speed](https://vitejs.dev/guide/why.html) in the modern era and takes advantage of modern browser features like native ES modules support to remove bundling entirely during development and adopts performance leading technologies like [esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild) to pre-bundle dependencies and [transpile TypeScript](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#typescript) which is able to do **20-30x** faster than TypeScript's own `tsc` compiler.

Ultimately its architectural choices allows Vite to deliver Lightning Fast **Hot Module Reload** (HMR) to remain at the developer-experience forefront of modern web development serving a [growing ecosystem](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) of frameworks with a rich typed suite of [Universal Plugins](https://vitejs.dev/plugins/).

### Vue SSG or SPA

Both Vue & Vite being led by [Evan You](https://github.com/yyx990803), which ensures both have stellar integration and delivers a well-supported & productive development experience making it the clear choice for any new Vue project.

Both vue-ssg.jamstacks.net and vue-vite.jamstacks.net utilizing the same high-end Vue3, TypeScript and Tailwind components means their included pages like **TODOs MVC**, **Bookings** and **Sign In** contain **identical source code**, the choice on which to use effectively becomes if you need advanced features like [Static Site Generation](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-au/learning/performance/static-site-generator/) **(SSG)** and **Dark Mode** or would otherwise prefer to start with a simpler template.

#### Features list comparison

 - vue-ssg.jamstacks.net/features
 - vue-vite.jamstacks.net/features

### Stale-while-revalidate in Vue3

Just like [Next.js's Stale While Revalidate](#stale-while-revalidate), both Vue templates includes a `swrClient` providing a typed wrapper around [SWVR](https://github.com/Kong/swrv) Vue3 composition library around making typed SWR API Requests using ServiceStack’s typed `JsonServiceClient`, e.g:

```html
<template>
  <div v-if="error">{{ error.message }}</div>
  <div v-else>{{data ? data.result :'loading...'}}</div>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
import { Hello } from "@/dtos"
import { swrClient } from "@/api"

const props = defineProps<{ name: string }>()

const { data, error } = swrClient.get(() => 
    new Hello({ name: props.name }))
</script>
```

Where it yields the same optimal UX with cached API responses rendered instantly before later updating itself if modified.

## Vue SSG

React & Next.js are primarily corporate-led efforts whilst the Vue ecosystem is largely community led, with one of Vue's lieutenants [Anthony Fu](https://github.com/antfu) being the primary developer behind many of the developer-experience focused features adopted in his [vite-ssg](https://github.com/antfu/vite-ssg) project. Most of these features are designed to reduce developer effort by auto registering routes and components by convention which effectively gives it [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org) like productivity by utilizing hand-picked quality dependencies without needing to be reliant on the slow development pace of a heavy framework like Nuxt.

Anthony's own opinionated Vite Starter Template - [Vitesse](https://github.com/antfu/vitesse) serves as a great resource for an experienced insight into a curated list of Vue & Vite packages offering the nicest developer experience, although Vue SSG will be more conservative and adopt more well-known technologies like [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) in favor of [Windi CSS](https://github.com/windicss/windicss).

Otherwise, it's still jam-packed full of features for modern Web Apps, including built-in **Dark Mode** support:

<a class="flex flex-col justify-center items-center my-8" href="https://vue-ssg.jamstacks.net">
    <img src="/img/pages/jamstack/vue-ssg-home.png" class="max-w-screen-md">
</a>

## Vue Vite

Don't need SSG or Dark mode? Try the simpler **SPA** template instead:

<a class="flex flex-col justify-center items-center my-8 pb-8" href="https://vue-vite.jamstacks.net">
    <img src="/img/pages/jamstack/vue-vite-home.png" class="max-w-screen-md">
</a>

## New /api route

As ServiceStack is an equal Content-Type Services Framework capable of hosting your APIs in a myriad of [different Data Formats and Endpoints](/why-servicestack#multiple-pluggable-formats), its [pre-defined routes](/routing#pre-defined-routes) were designed to cater for multiple formats and calling conventions. However, over the last decade [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) has stood out and become more popular than all others combined, where it's the lingua franca for calling APIs in Web Apps and what our [Add ServiceStack Reference](/add-servicestack-reference) ecosystem of languages relies on.

With JSON's increasing popularity in Mobile, Web & Desktop Apps and the advent of our flagship Jamstack templates we've decided to elevate its status and give it a pre-defined route of its very own at:

<h3 class="text-4xl text-center text-indigo-800 pb-3">/api/{Request}</h3>

This simple and popular convention makes it easy to remember the route new APIs are immediately available on & also pairs nicely with:

<h3 class="text-4xl text-center text-indigo-800 pb-3">/ui/{Request}</h3>

i.e. An easy to remember route for API Explorer's Auto Form UI, together we expect both to yield greater utility [out-of-the-box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_of_the_box_(feature)) in ServiceStack Apps. 

### Benefits in Jamstack Apps

The new `/api` route is particularly useful in Jamstack Apps as the 2 ways to call back-end APIs from decoupled UIs hosted on CDNs is to make CORS requests which doesn't send pre-flight CORS requests for [Simple Browser requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#simple_requests). As such, we can improve the latency of **GET** and **POST** API Requests by configuring our `JsonServiceClient` to use `/api` and to not send the `Content-Type: application/json` HTTP Header which isn't necessary for `/api` who always expects and returns JSON:

### Configuring in TypeScript

```ts
export const client = new JsonServiceClient(API_URL).apply(c => {
    c.basePath = "/api"
    c.headers = new Headers() //avoid pre-flight CORS requests
})
```

It also benefits the **alternative method** to CORS in only needing to define a **single reverse proxy rule** on the CDN host to proxy all API requests to downstream back-end servers.

#### Configuring in .NET

No configuration is necessary for the new **.NET 6+** [JsonApiClient](#jsonapiclient) that's pre-configured to use `/api` fallback by default:

```csharp
var client = new JsonApiClient(baseUri);
```

All .NET Clients use any **matching user-defined routes** defined on the Request DTO with the existing Service Clients falling back to `/json/[reply|oneway]` if none exist who can be configured to use the `/api` fallback with:

```csharp
var client = new JsonServiceClient(baseUri) {
    UseBasePath = "/api"
};
var client = new JsonHttpClient(baseUri) {
    UseBasePath = "/api"
};
```

### ApiHandlers

Using the new [ApiHandlers](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/src/ServiceStack/ApiHandlers.cs), the code to enable the new `/api` pre-defined route is just:

```csharp
RawHttpHandlers.Add(ApiHandlers.Json("/api/{Request}"));
```

`ApiHandlers` is a simpler wrapper that registers a Raw HttpHandler delegating all matching requests to a `GenericHandler` configured with that Mime Type and includes typed overloads for each built-in data format. 

So you could also define a new pre-defined route at `/excel/*` with:

```csharp
RawHttpHandlers.Add(ApiHandlers.Csv("/excel/{Request}"));
```

Where it can now be used to download any APIs response in a `*.csv` file.

To avoid potential conflicts `/api` isn't registered if your AppHost configures its own Custom BasePath, or can be explicitly disabled with:

```csharp
ConfigurePlugin<PredefinedRoutesFeature>(feature => feature.JsonApiRoute = null);
```

## Configuring Plugins, Operations and AppHost

The new [Modular Startup](/releases/v5_13#new-modular-startup) added in the last release allows us to make use of ASP .NET Core's `HostingStartup` to configure our App in layered modular building blocks. Most plugins are self-contained however but also often enhances another plugins functionality which can be difficult using layered blocks without manually specifying ordering to control the order plugins are loaded.

### ConfigurePlugin

The new `ConfigurePlugin` API now lets us avoid this time-coupling and lets us configure plugins before they've been added by registering a lazy callback invoked just before a plugin is registered. 

As it's resilient against ordering, it's now the recommended way to **configure any plugin** it doesn't register, here's some usage examples:

```csharp
// App's can use to change logo API Explorer uses
appHost.ConfigurePlugin<UiFeature>(feature => {
    feature.Info.BrandIcon.Uri = "https://example.org/logo.svg";
});

// OpenApiFeature uses to add the /swagger-ui link to /metadata page
appHost.ConfigurePlugin<MetadataFeature>(
    feature => feature.AddPluginLink(swaggerUrl, "Swagger UI"));

// GrpcFeature uses to add a link to gRPC .proto APIs on /metadata page
appHost.ConfigurePlugin<MetadataFeature>(
    feature => feature.AddPluginLink("types/proto", "gRPC .proto APIs"));
```

`ConfigurePlugin` is invoked just before a plugin is registered, there's also `PostConfigurePlugin` to configure a plugin just after it's registered and `AfterPluginLoaded` invoked after any of its `IPostInitPlugin` callbacks have completed.

### ConfigureOperation

The new `ConfigureOperation` method has the same benefits for configuring an APIs metadata which is especially useful for [AutoQuery AutoGen](/autoquery/autogen) services since its operation metadata only exists after its default implementation is generated by AutoGen:

```csharp
appHost.ConfigureOperation<Register>(op => op.FormLayout = new()
{
    new(){ Input.For<Register>(x => x.DisplayName, x => x.Help = "Your first and last name") },
    new(){ Input.For<Register>(x => x.Email, x => x.Type = Input.Types.Email) },
    new(){ Input.For<Register>(x => x.Password, x => x.Type = Input.Types.Password) },
    new(){ Input.For<Register>(x => x.ConfirmPassword, x => x.Type = Input.Types.Password) },
});
```

### ConfigureAppHost

The same functionality used to configure your AppHost before it exists in `HostingStartup` configurations, now exists in the stand-alone `HostContext.ConfigureAppHost()` API which also lets you lazily configure your ServiceStack AppHost at any point before it's initialized:

```csharp
HostContext.ConfigureAppHost(
    beforeConfigure: appHost => ...,
    afterConfigure: appHost => ...,
    afterPluginsLoaded: appHost => ...,
    afterAppHostInit: appHost => ...);
```

## JsonApiClient

Thanks to ServiceStack's new **net6.0** target framework builds we're able to easily add functionality that takes advantage of **.NET 6 features** which we'll increasingly continue to do in future making it the best and recommended runtime to run ServiceStack.

Previously .NET had 2 Service Clients they could use to make its typed API Requests:

 - **JsonServiceClient** - Utilizing .NET's older `HttpWebRequest`
 - **JsonHttpClient** - Utilizing .NET's newer `HttpClient` requiring **ServiceStack.HttpClient** NuGet package

In .NET Core, .NET's `HttpWebRequest` is implemented as a less optimized wrapper around `HttpClient` as such it was recommended to use `JsonHttpClient` directly which previously required an additional dependency to be added to **ServiceStack.HttpClient** NuGet package.

#### New for .NET 6+

Courtesy of being built-into **net6.0** the new `JsonApiClient` in this release is now available in **ServiceStack.Client** that's an enhanced version of `JsonHttpClient` which:

 - Is pre-configured with the new `/api` fallback route
 - Disables `EnableAutoRefreshToken` for fetching new JWT BearerTokens (implemented server-side from **v6**)
 - Has been updated to use **#nullable** annotations for better static analysis around correct usage
 - Supports **Brotli** Request Body Compression

### Synchronous Requests are Back!

Until adding **net6.0** TFM builds there was no officially supported way to perform synchronous requests with `HttpClient`, to implement the complete `IServiceClient` interface, `JsonHttpClient` had to adopt the [least problematic sync-over-async](https://blog.stephencleary.com/2012/07/dont-block-on-async-code.html) solution. 

`JsonApiClient` improves its synchronous support by rewriting all Sync methods to use HttpClient's new blocking **Send()** method. Whilst Blocking I/O continues to impact scalability, it's nice to finally have an **officially supported** method free from deadlock concerns.

#### Recommended ServiceClient for .NET 6+

Going forward we'll continue improving **JsonApiClient** with new .NET runtime features and optimizations as they're available and now that .NET's `HttpWebRequest` has been officially deprecated in **.NET 6+** we recommend switching to `JsonApiClient` in **.NET 6+** runtimes.

#### HttpClient Factory Registration

.NET's `HttpClient` is a [weirdly designed class](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/implement-resilient-applications/use-httpclientfactory-to-implement-resilient-http-requests) which despite implementing `IDisposable` shouldn't be used transitively, it also shouldn't be used as a singleton making it difficult to work with directly. The recommendation is to instead use a HttpClient Factory which can be done to register the `JsonApiClient` dependency in your App with:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddJsonApiClient(builder.Configuration["BaseUrl"]);
```

**Blazor WASM** should instead use the tailored `AddBlazorApiClient()` which also configures a CORS-enabled typed `JsonApiClient`:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddBlazorApiClient(builder.Configuration["ApiBaseUrl"] ?? builder.HostEnvironment.BaseAddress);
```

## New ergonomic `Api` and `ApiAsync` methods

.NET was originally conceived to use Exceptions for error control flow however there's been a tendency in modern languages & libraries to shun Exceptions and return errors as normal values, an approach we believe is a more flexible & ergonomic way to handle API responses.

### The ApiResult way

The new APIs simply returns a typed `ApiResult<Response>` Value Result that encapsulates either a Typed Response or a structured API Error populated in `ResponseStatus` allowing you to handle API responses programmatically without `try/catch` handling:

```ts
const api = client.api(new Hello({ name }))
if (api.failed) {
    console.log(`Greeting failed! ${api.error.errorMessage}`)
    return
}

console.log(`API Says: ${api.response.result}`) //api.succeeded
```

### C# Example

We've already seen a preview of what this looks like in [Blazor WASMs Dev Model Preview](#developer-productivity-preview) example code to create a new Booking:

```csharp
CreateBooking request = new();

ApiResult<IdResponse> api = new();

async Task OnSubmit()
{
    api = await Client.ApiAsync(request);

    if (api.Succeeded)
    {
        await done.InvokeAsync(api.Response!);
        request = new();
    }
}
```

Which despite its terseness handles both **success** and **error** API responses, **if successful** it invokes the `done()` callback notifying its parent of the new Booking API Response before resetting the Form's data model with a new Request DTO.

Upon **failure** the error response is populated in `api.Error` which binds to the UI via Blazor's `<CascadingValue Value=@api.Error>` to propagate it to all its child components in order to show contextual validation errors next to their respective Input controls.

### Simplified API Handling

Being able to treat errors as values greatly increases the ability to programmatically handle and genericize api handling, while it also greatly simplifies functionality needing to handle both successful and error responses like binding to UI components.

An example of this is below where we're able to concurrently fire off multiple unrelated async requests in parallel, wait for them all to complete, print out the ones that have succeeded or failed then access their strong typed responses: 

```ts
import { JsonServiceClient } from "@servicestack/client"

let requests:ApiRequest[] = [
    new AppOverview(),            // GET => AppOverviewResponse
    new DeleteTechnology(),       // DELETE => IReturnVoid (requires auth) 
    new GetAllTechnologies(),     // GET => GetAllTechnologiesResponse
    new GetAllTechnologyStacks(), // GET => GetAllTechnologyStacksResponse
]

let results = await Promise.all(requests.map(async (request) =>
    ({ request, api:await client.api(request) as ApiResponse}) ))

let failed = results.filter(x => x.api.failed)
console.log(`${failed.length} failed:`)
failed.forEach(x =>
    console.log(`    ${x.request.getTypeName()} Request Failed: ${failed.map(x => x.api.errorMessage)}`))

let succeeded = results.filter(x => x.api.succeeded)
console.log(`\n${succeeded.length} succeeded: ${succeeded.map(x => x.request.getTypeName()).join(', ')}`)

let r = succeeded.find(x => x.request.getTypeName() == 'AppOverview')?.api.response as AppOverviewResponse
if (r) console.log(`Top 5 Technologies: ${r.topTechnologies.slice(0,4).map(tech => tech.name).join(', ')}`)
```

Output:

```
1 failed:
    DeleteTechnology Request Failed: Unauthorized

3 succeeded: AppOverview, GetAllTechnologies, GetAllTechnologyStacks
Top 5 Technologies: Redis, MySQL, Amazon EC2, Nginx
```

Here treating Errors as values dramatically reduces the effort required to accomplish the same feat when handling errors with **try/catch**.

### Available in all .NET and TypeScript Clients

We'll eventually deliver the benefits of these new APIs to all [Add ServiceStack Reference](/add-servicestack-reference) languages, as of this writing the new `Api` and `ApiAsync` methods is available in all .NET Service Clients, including Service Gateway's as well as the `@servicestack/client` library servicing TypeScript and Vanilla JS projects. (inc. `/js/servicestack-client.js`).

## All APIs have a preferred default method

Like the `Send*` APIs before them, both **API Explorer** and the new `Api*` methods send API requests using an APIs **preferred HTTP Method** which can be defined either:

 - Explicitly annotating Request DTOs with `IGet`, `IPost`, etc. **IVerb** interface markers
 - Using the verb specified in its user-defined `[Route]` attribute (if single verb specified)
 - Implicitly when using AutoQuery/CRUD Request DTOs
 - Using the Services **Verb()** implementation method if not using **Any()**

If the HTTP Method can't be inferred, it defaults to using HTTP **POST**. But as good API documentation practice, we recommend specifying the HTTP Method each API should use, preferably using the `IVerb` interface marker, so it's embedded into the APIs Services Contract shared with clients (not required for AutoQuery APIs).

## Brotli Compression

Another new **.NET 6** feature we're happy to finally have access to is .NET Core's `BrotliStream` which now fully supported throughout ServiceStack, e.g. in Cached & Compressed Responses as well as sending compressed Request payloads in Service Clients.

The inclusion of Brotli triggered us to overhaul our compression abstractions whose implementations are now contained within:

 - **BrotliCompressor** - Brotli (br)
 - **DeflateCompressor** - Deflate (deflate)
 - **GZipCompressor** - GZIP (gzip)

Which now all implement the same substitutable interface:

```csharp
public interface IStreamCompressor
{
    string Encoding { get; }
    
    byte[] Compress(string text, Encoding? encoding = null);
    byte[] Compress(byte[] bytes);
    Stream Compress(Stream outputStream, bool leaveOpen=false);

    string Decompress(byte[] zipBuffer, Encoding? encoding = null);
        
    Stream Decompress(Stream zipBuffer, bool leaveOpen=false);

    byte[] DecompressBytes(byte[] zipBuffer);
}
```

That are managed with `StreamCompressors` in the **ServiceStack.Client** package:

```csharp
public static class StreamCompressors
{
    // Is there a compressor registered with this encoding?   
    public static bool SupportsEncoding(string? encoding);

    // return the registered IStreamCompressor implementation for for this
    public static IStreamCompressor? Get(string? encoding);
    
    // Assert there exists a IStreamCompressor for this encoding
    public static IStreamCompressor GetRequired(string encoding);

    // Register a new compressor for a specific encoding (defaults: gzip, deflate, br*) .NET6+
    public static void Set(string encoding, IStreamCompressor compressor);

    // Remove compression support for this encoding
    public static bool Remove(string encoding);
}
```

Containing pre-registered implementations of all popular Brotli, Deflate & gzip HTTP Compression algorithms so there's typically no need to add any yourself.

The preferred compression implementation for a request can be retrieved with `IRequest.GetCompressor()` which determines the implementation to use based on the overridable `GetCompressionType(IRequest request)` method in your AppHost.

### Brotli disabled for Firefox

Brotli is currently not returned for Firefox browsers (by **UserAgent** detection in `AppHost.GetCompressionType()`) which for a yet to be determined reason is the only modern browser that doesn't support .NET's `BrotliStream` output. We'll continue to investigate and remove the restriction when resolved.

## JWT Changes

From this major release, we're changing the default configuration of the [JWT Auth Provider](/auth/jwt-authprovider) to use **HTTP Token Cookies by default** which is both recommended [for Web Apps](https://stormpath.com/blog/where-to-store-your-jwts-cookies-vs-html5-web-storage#where-to-store-your-jwts), but is also better able to support effortless JWT Token management features.

Although this is technically a **breaking change** in clients that were manually handling BearerTokens returned in `AuthenticateResponse`, it's the more interoperable solution as the normal client logic for authenticating using normal [Server Session Cookies](/auth/sessions), e.g:

```csharp
let api = client.api(new Authenticate({ provider:'credentials', userName, password, rememberMe }))
```

Also works transparently after a configuring to use JWT on the server to switch to using stateless JWT Tokens, as in both cases the HTTP Clients utilize Cookies to enable authenticated requests.

### Transparent Server Auto Refresh of JWT Tokens

JWTs enable stateless authentication of clients without servers needing to maintain any Auth state in server infrastructure or perform any I/O to validate a token. As such, [JWTs are a popular choice for Microservices](/auth/jwt-authprovider#stateless-auth-microservices) as they only need to configured with confidential keys to validate access.

But to be able to terminate a users access, they need to revalidate their eligibility to verify they're still allowed access (e.g. deny Locked out users). This JWT revalidation pattern is implemented using [Refresh Tokens](/auth/jwt-authprovider#refresh-tokens) which are used to request revalidation of their access with a new JWT Access Token which they'll be able to use to make authenticated requests until it expires.

Previously the management of **auto refreshing expired JWT Access Tokens** was done with logic built into each of our smart generic Service Clients. But switching to use Token Cookies allows us to implement the revalidation logic on the server where it's now able to do this **transparently for all HTTP Clients**, i.e. it's no longer just limited to our typed Service Clients. 

### Revert to Bearer Token Responses

If you're not ready to move to HTTP Token Cookies yet, you can revert to the previous behavior of returning JWT Tokens in `AuthenticateResponse` API responses with:

```csharp
new JwtAuthProvider(AppSettings) {
    UseTokenCookie = false
}
```

### Large Profile Image handling in JWT Cookies

This is one feature we wished we never had to build, unfortunately due to trade-offs of competing solutions, we've had to surface different solutions, so you can choose the one that best suits your needs.

### Microsoft Graph Auth

Large Image profiles is an issue limited to [Microsoft Graph Auth](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/), since in its wisdom it has chosen not to return a public CDN URL of a Users Profile Image (like every other OAuth Provider). Instead, it pushes the burden of profile image management down to every authenticating App server, which to maintain their **statelessness**, means converting into a [Data URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs), except as it typically returns the high-res image JPEG which far exceeds the maximum **4kb** limit of cookies, it requires resizing in order to make fit (otherwise the JWT Cookie is ignored and Authentication will fail). [Microsoft Graph](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/profilephoto-get?view=graph-rest-1.0#path-parameters) does provide APIs to resize photos, unfortunately even its lowest **48x48** resolution is still too large for storage in Cookies. 

#### State of Imaging on Linux

This forces us to use .NET's built-in System.Drawing APIs to resize it, this works fine on Windows up until you need to deploy on Linux where you're met with the state of Imaging on Linux which can best be described as **undesirable** - at least as it exists in ASP .NET's official .NET 6 Docker Images. Resizing with System.Drawing immediately fails, so will [SkiaSharp](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp) even with its NativeAssets.Linux package references, we finally got it to successfully resize using [ImageSharp](https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp) except that doing it in a HTTP/2 request would reliably kill the connection, that even buffering couldn't avoid. Suffice to say this experience taught us to not rely on Imaging functionality in .NET runtimes on Linux. We've had previous success using SkiaSharp in a [Custom Linux Docker Image](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/Imgur) before & will likely work again with the appropriate OS packages, however it needs to reliably work in all popular hosting options to be acceptable for ServiceStack to adopt.

#### Large Profile Image Handling workarounds

Given Image resizing within the same OAuth request is off-limits, we needed to explore some other solutions. Since resizing did actually work in ImageSharp we could offload the task to a [Background MQ](/background-mq) and push the resized Data URI down to the user (e.g. with [Server Events](/server-events)) but that would result in a UI yank of the profile image and force developers to manage the complexity of additional client & server configuration which isn't a burden we want to impose due to their choice of OAuth providers.

The best working solution we could come up with that's able to display a users high-res photo whilst still keeping our App server stateless was to create a new  [ImagesHandler](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/src/ServiceStack/ImagesHandler.cs) that the JWT AuthProvider calls `RewriteImageUri()` on to replace any large profile URLs with a link to its `/auth-profiles/{MD5}.jpg` - a URL it also handles serving the original high-res image back to.

This is the solution `AuthFeature` uses by default, pre-configured with:

```csharp
new AuthFeature {
    ProfileImages = new ImagesHandler("/auth-profiles", fallback: Svg.GetStaticContent(Svg.Icons.DefaultProfile))
}
```

Where if using a custom [SavePhotoSize](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/blazor-wasm/blob/main/MyApp/appsettings.Development.json#L30) will be resized using Microsoft Graph APIs, if the resized image size still exceeds the max allowable size in JWT Cookies it's swapped out for a URL reference to the image which ImageHandler stores in memory. The trade-off of this default is when your Docker App is re-deployed, whilst their stateless authentication keeps them authenticated, the original high-res photo saved in ImageHandler's memory will be lost, which will be replaced with the fallback `Svg.Icons.DefaultProfile` image.

Using an MD5 hash does allow us to maintain URLs that's both predictable in that it will result in the same hash after every sign in, while also preventing information leakage that using a predictable User Id would do. A client-only solution that could retain their avatar across deployments is saving it to localStorage however that pushes the burden down to every client App using your APIs, which could be manageable if you control all of them.

#### Persistent Large Profile Image Handling

For a persistent solution that retains profile images across deployments you can use `PersistentImagesHandler` with the VFS Provider and path for profile images to be written to, e.g:

```csharp
new AuthFeature {
    ProfileImages = new PersistentImagesHandler("/auth-profiles", Svg.GetStaticContent(Svg.Icons.DefaultProfile),
        appHost.VirtualFiles, "/App_Data/auth-profiles")
}
```

When using the default `FileSystemVirtualFiles` VFS provider this would require configuring your Docker App with a persistent `/App_Data` Volume, otherwise using one of the other [Virtual Files Providers](/virtual-file-system) like `S3VirtualFiles` or `AzureBlobVirtualFiles` may be the more preferable solution to keep your Docker Apps stateless.

### AuthSecret HttpHeader

[AdminAuthSecret](/debugging#admin-role) is a quick way to configure your App with a Super User Account for accessing the Admin only services like [Admin UI](#admin-ui):

```csharp
SetConfig(new HostConfig {
    AdminAuthSecret = authsecret,
})
```

In addition to **authsecret** QueryString, FormData or Cookie, it can also be sent with any request with the `authsecret` HTTP Header, e.g:

```ts
let client = new JsonServiceClient(BaseUrl).apply(c => {
    c.basePath = '/api'
    c.headers.set('authsecret', authsecret)
})
```

### RegisterResponse as a substitutable Authentication source

Typically, to verify a user is authenticated you would call `Authenticate` without any params, e.g:

```ts
let api = client.api(new Authenticate())
let isAuthenticated = api.succeeded
```

Or via JSONP:

```html
<script>
function loadAuth(auth) { window.AUTH = auth.responseStatus ? null : auth }
</script>
<script src="/auth?callback=loadAuth"></script>
```

To save the additional call, new users signing up through the **Register** API with `AutoLogin=true` returns the same information as `AuthenticateResponse`, i.e. it's been extended to return:

 - Roles
 - Permissions
 - JWT Cookie or Bearer/Refresh Tokens

Allowing its response to be persisted in clients to indicate an Authenticated User Session.

## New Queryable PocoDataSource

**PocoDataSource** is useful for quickly creating an In Memory Queryable Data Source as done in the [TODOs MVC Jamstack Examples](#todos-mvc):

```csharp
public class TodosServices : Service
{
    public IAutoQueryData AutoQuery { get; set; }

    static readonly PocoDataSource<Todo> Todos = PocoDataSource.Create(new Todo[]
    {
        new () { Id = 1, Text = "Learn" },
        new () { Id = 2, Text = "Blazor", IsFinished = true },
        new () { Id = 3, Text = "WASM!" },
    }, nextId: x => x.Select(e => e.Id).Max());

    public object Get(QueryTodos query)
    {
        var db = Todos.ToDataSource(query, Request);
        return AutoQuery.Execute(query, AutoQuery.CreateQuery(query, Request, db), db);
    }

    public Todo Post(CreateTodo request)
    {
        var newTodo = new Todo { Id = Todos.NextId(), Text = request.Text };
        Todos.Add(newTodo);
        return newTodo;
    }

    public Todo Put(UpdateTodo request)
    {
        var todo = request.ConvertTo<Todo>();
        Todos.TryUpdateById(todo, todo.Id);
        return todo;
    }

    // Handles Deleting the Todo item
    public void Delete(DeleteTodo request) => Todos.TryDeleteById(request.Id);

    public void Delete(DeleteTodos request) => Todos.TryDeleteByIds(request.Ids);
}
```

Where it provides ThreadSafe CRUD operations to manage a collection of In Memory POCOs. 

### In Memory AutoQuery

The `QueryTodos` implementation utilizes an [AutoQuery Memory Source](/autoquery/memory) with the full capabilities of AutoQuery's [Implicit Conventions](/autoquery/rdbms#implicit-conventions):

 - [/api/QueryTodos?Id>=1](https://vue-vite-api.jamstacks.net/api/QueryTodos?Id>=1)
 - [/api/QueryTodos?TextContains=Blazor](https://vue-vite-api.jamstacks.net/api/QueryTodos?TextContains=Blazor)
 - [/api/QueryTodos?IsFinished=false](https://vue-vite-api.jamstacks.net/api/QueryTodos?IsFinished=false)

Where it can be used to iteratively prototype new data models under a productive **dotnet watch** workflow until it satisfies all your requirements where it could be easily converted to [AutoQuery CRUD](/autoquery/crud) APIs and integrated with your Systems configured RDBMS - which would require even less code.

#### AutoGen specific options in AutoGen DTOs

When using AutoGen to [generate Typed AutoQuery DTOs](/autoquery/autogen#generating-autoquery-types-services) for your RDBMS Tables:

```bash
$ x csharp https://localhost:5001 -path /crud/all/csharp
```

The generated `dtos.cs` now include AutoGen-specific options that can be used to maintain multiple custom RDBMS Tables and AutoQuery APIs, e.g. you could maintain one for each of your different RDBMS schemas:

```csharp
/* Options:
//...
//IncludeCrudOperations: 
Schema: custom
//NamedConnection: 
//IncludeTables: 
//ExcludeTables: 
*/
```

## Force Include Types in Native Types DTOs

ServiceStack's [Add ServiceStack Reference](/add-servicestack-reference) feature carefully limits which DTOs it generates based on just the DTOs needed by different clients packages to call APIs. There's many reasons why Types aren't generated, e.g. they already exist in service client library, the APIs have [Visibility or Access restrictions](/auth/restricting-services), their built-in APIs purposefully hidden by ServiceStack to reduce bloat, etc.

We can override these rules for specific Types by including them in `Metadata.ForceInclude`, e.g:

```csharp
public override void Configure(Container container)
{
    Metadata.ForceInclude = new() {
        typeof(MetadataApp),
        typeof(AppMetadata),
        typeof(AdminQueryUsers),
        typeof(AdminGetUser),
        typeof(AdminCreateUser),
        typeof(AdminUpdateUser),
        typeof(AdminDeleteUser),
    };
}
```

Add ServiceStack Reference still only generates dependent Types that your API references but the previous restrictions that prevented them from being generated will be lifted.

## Metadata pages

Whilst API Explorer received most of the attention in this release (and will continue to do so in future), we've also added the ability to browse an API Contract in the viewers preferred language in the existing API **/metadata** pages, e.g:

[![](/img/pages/apiexplorer/metadata-languages.png)](https://vue-vite-api.jamstacks.net/json/metadata?op=CreateBooking&lang=csharp)

The difference between them is that API Explorer is an entirely client rendered SPA that only supports modern browsers, whilst the **/metadata** pages are server rendered and should be visible in all browsers.

## Process Utils

Our [ProcessUtils.cs](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/src/ServiceStack.Common/ProcessUtils.cs) contains useful utils for managing & running external processes cross-platform, a new feature we've added is being able to easily run a shell command asynchronously, and emit its output in real-time, e.g:

```csharp
await ProcessUtils.RunShellAsync("npm run ui:build",
    onOut:   Console.WriteLine, 
    onError: Console.Error.WriteLine);
```

## ServiceStack.Text

The new overloads on ServiceStack.Text's convenience serialization methods `.ToJson()`, `.ToJsv()`, `.ToCsv()` now accept a lambda for configuring a custom configuration scope to simplify its usage, e.g:

```csharp
var json = dto.ToJson(config => config.TextCase = TextCase.SnakeCase);

// Equivalent To:
using var scope = JsConfig.With(new Config { TextCase = TextCase.Default });
var json = response.ToJson();
```
