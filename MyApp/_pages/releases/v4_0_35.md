title: ServiceStack v4.0.35
---

We're ending 2014 with a short release cycle primarily focused on a polished and fixes Release, ready for before everyone gets back at work - re-energized for a Happy New 2015 work year :)

## New [TechStacks](https://techstacks.io) LiveDemo!

We've been gradually refining our modern [AngularJS](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStackVS/blob/master/docs/angular-spa.md) and [React](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/Chat-React) Single Page App VS.NET templates which represents what we believe to be the optimal formula for developing future .NET-based JS Apps - utilizing a best-of-breed node.js, npm, bower, grunt/gulp build system.

To this end we're developing new Single Page Apps alongside to further refine these VS.NET templates and demonstrate their potential in using the pre-configured Grunt tasks to manage the full iterative client/server building, optimization and deployment dev workflows. 

We're happy to be able to preview the latest Live Demo built on the **AngularJS App** VS.NET template in: https://techstacks.io 

[![TechStacks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/Assets/master/img/livedemos/techstacks/screenshots/techstacks.png)](https://techstacks.io)

TechStacks is a modern [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) CRUD App that lets you Browse and Add Technology Stacks of popular StartUps. After Signing in you can add your own TechStacks and favorite technologies to create a personalized custom 'feed' to view Websites and Apps built with your favorite programming languages and technologies.

TechStacks is based on a [Bootstrap template](http://getbootstrap.com) with client-side features:

 - HTML5 Routing to enable pretty urls, also supports full page reloads and back button support
 - Same Services supporting both human-readable Slugs or int primary keys
 - Responsive design supporting iPad Landscape and Portrait modes
 - Preloading and background data fetching to reduce flicker and maximize responsiveness
 - [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) commenting system
 - [Chosen](http://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/) for UX-friendly multi combo boxes

and some of TechStacks back-end features include: 

 - [Twitter and GitHub OAuth Providers](/auth/authentication-and-authorization)
 - Substitutable [OrmLite](/ormlite/) RDBMS [PostgreSQL and Sqlite](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/TechStacks/blob/875e78910e43d2230f0925b71d5990497216511e/src/TechStacks/TechStacks/AppHost.cs#L49-L56) back-ends
 - [Auto Query](/autoquery/) for automatic services of RDBMS tables
 - [RDBMS Sessions and In Memory Caching](/caching)
 - [Smart Razor Views](https://razor.netcore.io)
 - [Fluent Validation](/validation)

TechStacks is a good example of the experience you can get running a packaged ServiceStack/AngularJS App on modest hardware - [techstacks.io](https://techstacks.io) is currently running on a single **m1.small** AWS EC2 instance and **db.t1.micro** RDS PostgreSQL instance that hosts all [Live Demos](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/LiveDemos).

### [View the Source](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/TechStacks)

Checkout the [Source Code for TechStacks](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/TechStacks) for the full details to see how it's built. The project also includes an [example client layout](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/TechStacks/tree/master/src/TechStacks/TechStacks/js) for structuring larger AngularJS projects in an extensible layout files and folder structure:

### HTML5 Routing and Full-page reloads

One of the disadvantages of Single Page Apps is having to resort to hash-style `#!` url suffix hacks to prevent JavaScript apps from making full-page reloads. By utilizing [AngularJS's HTML5 mode](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/$location#html5-mode) we can take advantage of modern browsers support for HTML5 History API to retain the optimal pretty urls (we'd have if this were a server generated website) whilst still retaining the responsiveness of JS Apps which are able to load just the minimum content required, i.e. instead of waiting for the full page rendering of Server generated pages and their resource dependencies to be loaded again.

ServiceStack has great support for these modern-style SPA's which lets you specify a fallback handler for **HTML page requests** with un-matched routes to return the same `/default.cshtml` home page so AngularJS is able to handle the request and perform the same client-side routing it would've had the url been navigated from within the App - using the [AppHost configuration below](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/TechStacks/blob/41efa5d8add1c4b0bdd449d6507878f2c8387bbc/src/TechStacks/TechStacks/AppHost.cs#L41):

```csharp
base.CustomErrorHttpHandlers[HttpStatusCode.NotFound] = new RazorHandler("/default.cshtml");
```

This lets you re-use pretty client-side routes like:

 - https://techstacks.io/tech/servicestack

And allow deep-link support for full round-trip requests (i.e. outside of AngularJS) - where since `/tech/servicestack` doesn't match any custom Server routes, ServiceStack instead responds with the above `/default.cshtml` Razor View. At which point AngularJS takes over and navigates to the internal route mapping that matches `/tech/servicestack`.

## ServerEvents now supports Multiple Channels per subscription

To ensure each Client only ever needs 1 ServerEvents subscription, subscriptions now support subscribing to multiple channels. Multi Channel Support is fully implemented in all [JavaScript ServerEvents](/javascript-server-events-client) and [C#/.NET ServerEvents](/csharp-server-events-client) Clients as well as both [back-end InMemory](/server-events) and [Redis ServerEvents](/redis-server-events) providers.

The API remains similar to the previous Single Channel Routes where in addition to subscribing to a single channel:

    /event-stream?channel=Home

Clients can also subscribe to multiple channels:

    /event-stream?channel=Home,Work,Play

> If preferred, clients can also use the more readable **?channels=** plural variable name

And the above example again using the [C#/.NET ServerEvents Client](/csharp-server-events-client):

```csharp
var client = new ServerEventsClient(BaseUri, "Home");

var client = new ServerEventsClient(BaseUri, "Home", "Work", "Play");
```

Multi-Channel subscriptions works conceptually similar to having multiple "single channel" subscriptions where multiple Join/Leave/Message events are fired for events occurring in each channel. For more details on this checkout the [multi-channel ServerEvents tests](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/42d08dee1f4945f1a7be29ac234ce1250e04de9b/tests/ServiceStack.WebHost.Endpoints.Tests/ServerEventTests.cs#L781).

### Chat Apps now support multiple Chat Rooms

With this feature, we can now create Chat Apps that support multiple Chat Rooms using only a single ServerEvents subscription: 

![React Multi-Channel Chat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/Assets/master/img/livedemos/chat-react-multichannels.png)

> Multi-Channel React Chat preview

Surprisingly it only took a small amount of code to add support for multiple chat rooms in all the different Chat Apps which now all support Multiple Chat rooms:

 - Upgrade [jQuery Chat Client/Server](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/Chat/commit/f23bb912791425abcba1bc724cd86cb4ab8cac82) to support multiple Chat Rooms
 - Upgrade [React Chat Client](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/Chat-React/commit/8969ce9c291d88f63d84500b3bb281c3b1f451c7) to support multiple Chat Rooms
 - Upgrade [React Chat Server](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/Chat-React/commit/cae43b6923771b02c28726dcfa4927d8490275ee) to support multiple Chat Rooms
 - Upgrade [ServiceStack.Gap Chat Client/Server](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Gap/commit/6ee72d81fcf7cd73573b686400500d7516f312b9) to support multiple Chat Rooms

Should you want to run the previous "Single Room" Chat Apps, they're available in the **single-channel** branches:

 - [jQuery Chat](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/Chat/tree/single-channel)
 - [React Chat](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/Chat-React/tree/singe-channel)

> Multi-Channel support is mostly backwards compatible where all Chat Apps can be run as-is when upgraded to use the latest ServiceStack v4.0.35+ - but it does require upgrading both v4.0.35 Client and Server libraries together.
