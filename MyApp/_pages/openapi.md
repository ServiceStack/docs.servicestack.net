::: info
For documentation on using `OpenApiFeature` refer to [Open API v2](/openapi-v2) instead
:::

Utilizing the same ASP.NET Core [Endpoint Routing](/endpoint-routing) that the rest of the ASP.NET Core App uses enables 
your ServiceStack APIs to integrate with your wider ASP.NET Core application, opening up more opportunities for greater reuse.

This opens up the ability to use common third party tooling to implement application-wide features like OpenAPI v3 specification 
generation support for your endpoints offered by the `Swashbuckle.AspNetCore` package.

To make this integration as easy as possible we're maintaining the `ServiceStack.AspNetCore.OpenApi` package to incorporate additional 
information from your ServiceStack APIs into Swagger metadata.

In this guide we will look at how you can take advantage of the new OpenAPI v3 Swagger support using mapped Endpoints, 
customizing the generated specification, as well as touch on other related changes when using [Endpoint Routing](/endpoint-routing).

## AppHost Initialization

To use Swashbuckle your ServiceStack App needs to be configured to use [Endpoint Routing](/endpoint-routing) and
[ASP.NET Core IOC](/net-ioc) where registration of your ServiceStack Services and App's Dependencies & Plugins need to be setup
before your `WebApplication` is built, e.g:

#### Program.cs
```csharp
// Register ServiceStack APIs, Dependencies and Plugins:
services.AddServiceStack(typeof(MyServices).Assembly);

var app = builder.Build();
//...

// Register ServiceStack AppHost
app.UseServiceStack(new AppHost(), options => {
    options.MapEndpoints();
});

app.Run();
```

Once configured to use Endpoint Routing we can then use the [mix](https://docs.servicestack.net/mix-tool) tool to apply the 
[openapi3](https://gist.github.com/gistlyn/dac47b68e77796902cde0f0b7b9c6ac2) Startup Configuration with:

:::sh
x mix openapi3
:::

### Manually Configure OpenAPI v3 and Swagger UI 

This will install the required ASP.NET Core Microsoft, Swashbuckle and ServiceStack Open API NuGet packages:

```xml
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi" Version="8.*" />
<PackageReference Include="Swashbuckle.AspNetCore" Version="7.*" />
<PackageReference Include="ServiceStack.AspNetCore.OpenApi" Version="8.*" />
```

Then add the `Configure.OpenApi.cs` [Modular Startup](https://docs.servicestack.net/modular-startup) class to your project:

```csharp
[assembly: HostingStartup(typeof(MyApp.ConfigureOpenApi))]

namespace MyApp;

public class ConfigureOpenApi : IHostingStartup
{
    public void Configure(IWebHostBuilder builder) => builder
        .ConfigureServices((context, services) =>
        {
            if (context.HostingEnvironment.IsDevelopment())
            {
                services.AddEndpointsApiExplorer();
                services.AddSwaggerGen(); // Swashbuckle

                services.AddServiceStackSwagger();
                services.AddBasicAuth<ApplicationUser>(); // Enable HTTP Basic Auth
                //services.AddJwtAuth(); // Enable & Use JWT Auth

                services.AddTransient<IStartupFilter, StartupFilter>();
            }
        });

    public class StartupFilter : IStartupFilter
    {
        public Action<IApplicationBuilder> Configure(Action<IApplicationBuilder> next)
            => app => {
                // Provided by Swashbuckle library
                app.UseSwagger();
                app.UseSwaggerUI();
                next(app);
            };
    }
}
```

All this setup is done for you in our updated [Identity Auth .NET 8 Templates](https://servicestack.net/start).

## Open API Attributes

Each route could have a separate summary and description. You can set it with `Route` attribute:

```csharp
[Route("/hello", Summary = @"Default hello service.", 
    Notes = "Longer description for hello service.")]
```

You can set specific description for each HTTP method like shown below:

```csharp
[Route("/hello/{Name}", "GET", Summary="Says 'Hello' to provided Name", 
    Notes = "Longer description of the GET method which says 'Hello'")]
[Route("/hello/{Name}", "POST", Summary="Says 'Hello' to provided Name", 
    Notes = "Longer description of the POST method which says 'Hello'")]
```

You can also document your services in the OpenAPI with the new `[Api]` and `[ApiMember]` annotation attributes, e,g: Here's an example of a fully documented service:

```csharp
[Api("Service Description")]
[Tag("Core Requests")]
[ApiResponse(HttpStatusCode.BadRequest, "Your request was not understood")]
[ApiResponse(HttpStatusCode.InternalServerError, "Oops, something broke")]
[Route("/swagger/{Name}", "GET", Summary = "GET Summary", Notes = "Notes")]
[Route("/swagger/{Name}", "POST", Summary = "POST Summary", Notes="Notes")]
public class MyRequestDto
{
    [ApiMember(Name="Name", Description = "Name Description",
        ParameterType = "path", DataType = "string", IsRequired = true)]
    [ApiAllowableValues("Name", typeof(Color))] //Enum
    public string Name { get; set; }
}
```

Please note, that if you used `ApiMember.DataType` for annotating `OpenApiFeature` then you need to change the types to OpenAPI type when migrating to `OpenApiFeature`. For example, annotation of 
```csharp
[ApiMember(DataType="int")]
```
need to be changed to 
```csharp
[ApiMember(DataType="integer", Format="int32")]
```

Here is the table for type migration

:::{.table}
| Swagger Type (DataType) | OpenAPI Type (DataType) | OpenAPI Format (Format)     |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Array                   | array                   |                             |
| boolean                 | boolean                 |                             |
| byte                    | integer                 | int                         |
| Date                    | string                  | date                        |
|                         | string                  | date-time                   |
| double                  | number                  | double                      |
| float                   | number                  | float                       |
| int                     | integer                 | int32                       |
| long                    | integer                 | int64                       |
| string                  | string                  |                             |
:::

You can use `[ApiAllowableValues]` lets you anotate enum properties as well as a restriction for values in array, e.g:

```csharp
[ApiAllowableValues("Includes", Values = new string[] { "Genres", "Releases", "Contributors" })]
public string[] Includes { get; set; }
```

::: info
The use of `ApiMember` turns your DTO properties as **opt-in only** for OpenApi metadata.
Meaning that only properties annotated with `[ApiMember]` will be included in the OpenApi metadata for classes
that use `[ApiMember]` on any of its properties.
:::

### Group APIs with Tags

You can tag the DTO with `[Tag]` attribute. Attributes are annotated by the same tag are grouped by the tag name in Swagger UI. DTOs can have multiple tags, e.g:

```csharp
[Tag("Core Features")]
[Tag("Scheduler")]
public class MyRequest { ... }
```

You can Exclude **properties** from being listed in OpenAPI with:

```csharp
[IgnoreDataMember]
```

Exclude **properties** from being listed in OpenAPI Schema Body with:

```csharp
[ApiMember(ExcludeInSchema=true)]
```
### Exclude Services from Metadata Pages

To exclude entire Services from showing up in OpenAPI or any other Metadata Services (i.e. Metadata Pages, Postman, NativeTypes, etc), annotate **Request DTO's** with:

```csharp
[ExcludeMetadata]
public class MyRequestDto { ... }
```

## More Control

One point of friction with our previous `OpenApiFeature` plugin was the missing customization ability to the OpenAPI spec to somewhat disconnect from the defined ServiceStack service, and related C# Request and Response DTOs since it used Request DTOs property attributes making the *structure* of the OpenAPI schema mapping quite ridged, preventing the ability for certain customizations.

For example, if we have an `UpdateTodo` Request DTO that looks like the following class:

```csharp
[Route("/todos/{Id}", "PUT")]
public class UpdateTodo : IPut, IReturn<Todo>
{
    public long Id { get; set; }
    [ValidateNotEmpty]
    public string Text { get; set; }
    public bool IsFinished { get; set; }
}
```

Previously, we would get a default Swagger UI that enabled all the properties as `Paramters` to populate:

![](/img/pages/openapi/v3/openapi-v2-defaults.png)

While this correctly describes the Request DTO structure, sometimes as developers we get requirements for how we want to present our APIs to our users from within the Swagger UI. 

With the updated SwaggerUI, and the use of the `Swashbuckle` library, we get the following UI by default:

![](/img/pages/openapi/v3/openapi-v3-defaults-application-json.png)

These are essentially the same, we have a CRUD Todo API that takes a `UpdateTodo` Request DTO, and returns a `Todo` Response DTO. ServiceStack needs to have uniquely named Request DTOs, so we can't have a `Todo` schema as the Request DTO despite the fact that it is the same structure as our `Todo` model. 
This is a good thing, as it allows us to have a clean API contract, and separation of concerns between our Request DTOs and our models. 
However, it might not be desired to present this to our users, since it can be convenient to think about CRUD services as taking the same resource type as the response.

To achieve this, we use the Swashbuckle library to customize the OpenAPI spec generation. Depending on what you want to customize, you can use the `SchemaFilter` or `OperationFilter` options. In this case, we want to customize the matching operation to reference the `Todo` schema for the Request Body.

First, we create a new class that implements the `IOperationFilter` interface.

```csharp
public class OperationRenameFilter : IOperationFilter
{
    public void Apply(OpenApiOperation operation, OperationFilterContext context)
    {
        if (context.ApiDescription.HttpMethod == "PUT" &&
            context.ApiDescription.RelativePath == "todos/{Id}")
        {
            operation.RequestBody.Content["application/json"].Schema.Reference = 
                new OpenApiReference {
                    Type = ReferenceType.Schema,
                    Id = "Todo"
                };
        }
    }
}
```

The above matches some information about the `UpdateTodo` request we want to customize, and then sets the `Reference` property of the `RequestBody` to the `Todo` schema.
We can then add this to the `AddSwaggerGen` options in the `Program.cs` file.

```csharp
builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen(o =>
{
    o.OperationFilter<OperationRenameFilter>();
});
```

The result is the following Swagger UI:

![](/img/pages/openapi/v3/openapi-v3-customized-application-json.png)

This is just one simple example of how you can customize the OpenAPI spec generation, and `Swashbuckle` has some great documentation on the different ways you can customize the generated spec.
And these customizations impact any of your ASP.NET Core Endpoints, not just your ServiceStack APIs.

Now that ServiceStack APIs can be mapped to standard ASP.NET Core Endpoints, it opens up a lot of possibilities for integrating your 
ServiceStack APIs into the larger ASP.NET Core ecosystem.
