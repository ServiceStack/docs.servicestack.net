# Image to Image

AI Server has built-in ComfyUI workflows for doing image-to-image generation tasks like inpainting. This takes an image as input and generates a new image based on the input image and any additional prompts you provide.

## Other Image to Image Tasks

In addition to just Image to Image, AI Server also supports:

- **ImageWithMask**: This task takes an image and a mask as input and uses the provided prompts only for the matching masked area.
- **ImageUpscale**: This task takes an image and upscales it to a higher resolution using the provided prompts (2x only currently).
- **ImageToText**: This task takes an image and generates text based on the image content.

## Using Image to Image

To generate an image from an image, you can use the `ImageToImage` request:

```csharp
var request = new ImageToImage()
{
    PositivePrompt = "A beautiful sunset over the ocean",
    NegativePrompt = "A pixelated, low-quality image",
    Sync = true
};

var response = client.PostFilesWithRequest<GenerationResponse>(
    request,
    [new UploadFile("image", File.OpenRead("sunset.jpg"), "sunset.jpg")]
);
response.Outputs[0].Url.DownloadFileTo("ocean-sunset.webp");
```

A similar pattern can be used for the `ImageWithMask` request:

```csharp
var request = new ImageWithMask()
{
    PositivePrompt = "A beautiful sunset over the ocean",
    NegativePrompt = "A pixelated, low-quality image",
    Sync = true
};

var response = client.PostFilesWithRequest<GenerationResponse>(
    request,
    [new UploadFile("image", File.OpenRead("sunset.jpg"), "sunset.jpg"),
     new UploadFile("mask", File.OpenRead("mask.jpg"), "mask.jpg")]
);
response.Outputs[0].Url.DownloadFileTo("ocean-sunset.webp");
```

The `ImageUpscale` request is similar, but only requires the image file:

```csharp
var request = new ImageUpscale()
{
    Sync = true
};

var response = client.PostFilesWithRequest<GenerationResponse>(
    request,
    [new UploadFile("image", File.OpenRead("low-res.jpg"), "low-res.jpg")]
);
response.Outputs[0].Url.DownloadFileTo("high-res.webp");
```

Upscaling is currently limited to 2x the original resolution, and it requires ComfyUI has downloaded the necessary model "RealESRGAN_x2.pth" to perform the upscale.

## Image Manipulation

You can also use several other endpoints for basic image manipulation tasks:

- **CropImage**: This task crops an image based on the provided coordinates.
- **ConvertImage**: This task converts an image to a different format.
- **Variants**: This is will cache and return different variants of image artifacts already generated by the AI Server.

Since these tasks are more lightweight, they all run synchronously and do not require a model to be downloaded.

#### Crop Image

```csharp
var request = new CropImage()
{
    X = 120,
    Y = 120,
    Width = 720,
    Height = 720
};

// Returns the cropped image directly as a Stream
var response = client.PostFilesWithRequest<Stream>(
    request,
    [new UploadFile("image", File.OpenRead("image.jpg"), "image.jpg")]
);

File.WriteAllBytes("result.jpg",response.ReadFully());
```

#### Convert Image

```csharp
var request = new ConvertImage()
{
    OutputFormat = "webp"
};

var response = client.PostFilesWithRequest<Stream>(
    request,
    [new UploadFile("image", File.OpenRead("image.jpg"), "image.jpg")]
);

File.WriteAllBytes("image.webp",response.ReadFully());
```
