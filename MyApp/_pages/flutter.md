## Getting Started

Two mix templates to help you build services with Flutter clients are the `flutter` and `flutter-grpc` mix templates.

These templates create a new Flutter application using your locally installed [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) that comes wired up to the ServiceStack project template it is mixed into.

These mix templates can be added to ServiceStack templated projects using the [ServiceStack dotnet x tool](./dotnet-tool.md), which can be installed using the command:

```bash
$ dotnet tool install --global x 
```

## Pre-requisites

- Flutter SDK
- Dart SDK
- ServiceStack dotnet X tool

![](/img/pages/mix/flutter-mix-running-desktop.png)

## New or Existing Project

The Flutter integration works with most ServiceStack templates. It does make the assumption that when working locally, the initial Flutter application will connect to the ServiceStack host via `localhost:5001` or if the client is running on an Android Emulator, `10.0.0.2:5001`.

For example, you could [start with a new](/dotnet-new) `web` ServiceStack project to host your web services, and add a working Flutter client using the mix template.

```bash
$ x new web MyApp
```

Then from your new solution directory `MyApp`, mix in the Flutter application using:

```bash
$ x mix flutter
```

### Flutter Setup with gRPC

Alternatively, if you want to use **gRPC** for communication, you can use the `grpc` project template.

```bash
$ x new grpc MyApp
```

With the `flutter-grpc` mix template to get a gRPC equivalent setup just as quickly.

```bash
$ x mix flutter-grpc
```

## Project Structure

The `x mix flutter` template uses your locally installed Flutter SDK to create the initial Flutter application via the `flutter create` command.
It then overrides some source files, and adds some required Dart dependencies to facilitate the integration with your web services.

![](./img/pages/mix/flutter-mix-project-structure.png)

## Running

To develop on your Flutter client, it is best to take advantage of the hot reload functionality of both Flutter and `dotnet watch`.

### ServiceStack App

From your `web` project directory, navigate into your `MyApp` AppHost directory and run:

```bash
$ dotnet watch
```

Keep your services running, and open your `myapp_flutter` directory using [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/install).

### Flutter App

When building application in flutter, you can use various [IDEs or editors](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/editor?tab=androidstudio), but in this example we will be using Android Studio.
Flutter applications are written in the [Dart Language](https://dart.dev/overview), and since both are developed by Google, there are great resources for [learning both the Dart Language](https://dart.dev/guides), and the [Flutter Framework](https://docs.flutter.dev/reference/tutorials), included [dedicated resources for those familiar with Xamarin.Forms](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/flutter-for/xamarin-forms-devs).

When developing on Windows, Android Studio will automatically support `web` and `desktop` targets, as well as making it easier to set up and manage Android Emulated devices.

![](./img/pages/mix/flutter-mix-android-run-configs.png)

## Development

From Android Studio, you can target multiple platforms including Windows, Web and Android. If you are on Windows, targeting a Windows Desktop application can provide a rapid development cycle as Flutter Hot Reload works well and performs quickly.
And since ServiceStack can generate client [Data Transfer Objects](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff649585.aspx) or DTOs, we can have a [typed end-to-end service integration](./add-servicestack-reference) when developing Flutter client applications.

### Flutter `main.dart`

The `x mix flutter` command provides a customized `main.dart` with a built-in integration of the `Hello` API service of your local ServiceStack application.

This uses the `servicestack` Dart package which contains a supported [Service Client](./clients-overview). To support both web and non-web client targets, a `ClientFactory` is used with a conditional import of the platform specific service client from `servicestack/web_client.dart` for web, and `servicestack/client.dart` for all native platforms.

```dart
var baseUrl = "https://localhost:5001";
var clientOptions = ClientOptions(baseUrl: baseUrl);

client = ClientFactory.createWith(clientOptions);
runApp(const MyApp());
```

The use of Android Emulators for local development is catered for by checking if the application is not in release mode, is not a web platform and if it is running on the Android platform.

```dart
if (!kReleaseMode && !kIsWeb) {
  if (Platform.isAndroid) {
    clientOptions.baseUrl = "https://10.0.2.2:5001";
    clientOptions.ignoreCertificatesFor.add(clientOptions.baseUrl);
  }
}
```

This is done since Android Emulators have limited network access, and can only access the ServiceStack application running on the host. Android can only communicate with the host via the [aliased `10.0.2.2` IP address from the running emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-networking).

### Flutter Template Overview

Flutter applications use [`Widgets`](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/ui/widgets-intro) to build everything you see in a Flutter application.

> Widgets describe what their view should look like given their current configuration and state. When a widgetâ€™s state changes, the widget rebuilds its description, which the framework diffs against the previous description in order to determine the minimal changes needed in the underlying render tree to transition from one state to the next.

The `MyApp` widget is the entry point of our application, and the `MaterialApp` to default your Flutter application to use [Material Design](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/ui/material) as a style or theme.

```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  // This widget is the root of your application.
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: const HelloFlutter(title: 'Flutter Demo Home Page'), // Your app starts here
    );
  }
}
```

The `HelloFlutter` widget is a [`StatefulWidget`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/StatefulWidget-class.html) which references the `HelloFlutterState` class where the UI is declared and updates are made to the Flutter UI.

The example application listens for changes from the `TextField` using a `TextEditingController`, binding a `callService` method which fires whenever a change is made.

```dart
class HelloFlutterState extends State<HelloFlutter> {
  //State for this widget
  String result = "";
  var myController = TextEditingController();
  ...

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Listen for changes from the TextField and call our API
    myController.addListener(callService);
  }
  
  void callService() async {
    var text = myController.text.isEmpty ? "World" : myController.text;
    var response = await client.get(Hello(name: text));
    setState(() {
      result = response.result!;
    });
  }
  
@override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(//...
      body: Center(//..
        TextField(//..
          controller: myController,
      )
```

### Calling the Hello API

The `callService` method is an `async` method where Dart has a familiar syntax to dotnet. The generated Request and Response DTOs located in the `dtos.dart` file represent the same messages on our ServiceStack server, so we also get similar syntax and types when compared to calling from a dotnet client.

```dart
  void callService() async {
    var text = myController.text.isEmpty ? "World" : myController.text;
    var response = await client.get(Hello(name: text)); // response of type `HelloResponse`.
    setState(() {
      result = response.result!;
    });
  }
```

### Updating your client DTOs

During development of your web services, when changes are made to your Request DTO classes, your client sometimes needs to be aware of these changes.
Your client DTOs in the `lib/dtos.dart` file can be regenerated while your ServiceStack application is running by using the Servicestack dotnet x tool:

```bash
$ x dart
```

If you use Android Studio, there is also a ServiceStack IDEA Plugin for Jetbrains IDEs that can make it easy to quickly update your client DTOs.

![](./img/pages/mix/flutter-mix-update-dtos-ide.png)

::: info
To install the Plugin goto `Settings`->`Plugins`->Search Marketplace for `ServiceStack`.
:::

The `dtos.dart` file that comes with the Flutter `mix` template only contains DTOs for the default Hello service, but if other web services are running on your host application, updating your `dtos.dart` file using one of the above methods will then sync your client and server Request DTOs.

For example, if you use one of our [Jamstack templates](https://jamstacks.net), there is also a Todo service.

Running `x dart` in project terminal will update our DTOs, and we can query for `Todo` items using the following Dart syntax.

```dart
Future<QueryResponse<Todo>> queryTodos() async {
    return await client.get(QueryTodos());
}
```

The `Todo` is a shared model type, so we can use them in our application passing around the same data structure.

```dart
Future<Todo> updateTodo(Todo item) async {
    return await client.put(UpdateTodo(
        id: item.id,
        isFinished: (item.isFinished ?? false) ? true : false,
        text: item.text));
}
```

We've made an example codebase called [BookingsFlutter](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/BookingsFlutter) to show a more featured cross-platform application integrating with different types of services.

<lite-youtube class="w-full mx-4 my-4" width="560" height="315" videoid="eMbwaMuIk84" style="background-image: url('https://img.youtube.com/vi/eMbwaMuIk84/maxresdefault.jpg')"></lite-youtube>

## gRPC Examples

Create a new Flutter project with [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio):

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetCoreApps/todo-world/master/TodoWorld/wwwroot/assets/img/flutter/new-flutter-project.png)

Add protoc generated TodoWorld DTOs and gRPC GrpcServiceClient to `lib/` folder:

:::sh
x proto-dart https://todoworld.servicestack.net -out lib
:::

Add required dependencies to **pubspec.yaml**:

```yaml
dependencies:
  fixnum: ^0.10.11
  async: ^2.2.0
  protobuf: ^1.0.1
  grpc: ^2.1.3
```

Install dependencies by running `pub get` or clicking on **Get Dependencies** link in the IDE:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetCoreApps/todo-world/master/TodoWorld/wwwroot/assets/img/flutter/pub-get.png)

### Flutter protoc gRPC insecure Example

Use protoc generated DTOs and `GrpcServiceClient` to call TodoWorld gRPC Service in `_MyHomePageState`
class in `bin/main.dart`:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_grpc/services.pbgrpc.dart';
import 'package:grpc/grpc.dart';

//...

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  String result = '';
  GrpcServicesClient client = GrpcServicesClient(
      ClientChannel('todoworld.servicestack.net', port:50054,
          options:ChannelOptions(credentials: ChannelCredentials.insecure())));

  void _callGrpcService() async {
    var response = await client.getHello(Hello()..name="Flutter gRPC");
    setState(() {
      result = response.result;
    });
  }

  //...
}
```

Capture the result gRPC API request in the `result` String then change the Widget `build()` to
display that instead of `_counter` then update the `floatingActionButton` to call your `_callGrpcService`
method instead:

```dart
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text(widget.title),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'gRPC Service Example:',
            ),
            Text(
              '$result',
              style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.display1,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: _callGrpcService,
        tooltip: 'gRPC Service Example',
        child: Icon(Icons.play_arrow),
      ),
    );
  }
```

With Flutter's live-reload capability you should be able to see your changes instantly in the Android emulator
where clicking the icon should display the result of your plain-text gRPC Service Request:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetCoreApps/todo-world/master/TodoWorld/wwwroot/assets/img/flutter/flutter-grpc-insecure.png)

### Flutter protoc gRPC SSL Example

To use gRPC SSL we'll need a copy of our gRPC's Service SSL Certificate which we can make available to our
Flutter App by saving it to our App's `assets` directory:

```bash
mkdir assets
x get https://todoworld.servicestack.net/grpc.crt -out assets
```

As loading assets is an asynchronous operation we'll need to preload it either by loading it in `main()` and
passing it as an attribute down to all our components or we can load it in our State widget's `initState()`
method:

```dart
class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  String result = '';
  GrpcServicesClient client;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    DefaultAssetBundle.of(context).load("assets/grpc.crt").then((bytes) => setState(() {
      client = GrpcServicesClient(
          ClientChannel('todoworld.servicestack.net', port:50051,
              options:ChannelOptions(credentials: ChannelCredentials.secure(
                  certificates: bytes.buffer.asUint8List(),
                  authority: 'todoworld.servicestack.net'
              ))));
    }));
  }

  void _callGrpcService() async {
    var response = await client.getHello(Hello()..name="gRPC SSL");
    setState(() {
      result = response.result;
    });
  }

  //...
}
```

You'll also need to update the port to refer to the gRPC SSL endpoint, update your `Hello` request
so we can verify the result is from the new gRPC SSL request. Now after live-reload has completed,
clicking on the icon will show the response of a gRPC SSL Request:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetCoreApps/todo-world/master/TodoWorld/wwwroot/assets/img/flutter/flutter-grpc-ssl.png)

Refer to [/src/mobile/flutter/flutter_grpc](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/todo-world/tree/master/mobile/flutter/flutter_grpc)
for a complete example project.

### Flutter gRPC Mix Template

<lite-youtube class="w-full mx-4 my-4" width="560" height="315" videoid="fgts6sQ2Ags" style="background-image: url('https://img.youtube.com/vi/fgts6sQ2Ags/maxresdefault.jpg')"></lite-youtube>

The Flutter integration works with ServiceStack `grpc` template that has been *configured to support gRPC services*. It also makes the assumption that when working locally, the initial Flutter application will connect to the ServiceStack gRPC services via `localhost:5054` or if the client is running on an Android Emulator, `10.0.0.2:5054`.
`5054` is the insecure HTTP port that is used by the `grpc` project template, but if you want to add `grpc` support to your application using `x mix grpc`, be sure to set up the use of the same port for local development, or modify your Flutter client to match your server setup.

For example, you could [start with a new](/dotnet-new) `grpc` ServiceStack project to host your services via gRPC, and add a working Flutter client which connects via gRPC using the mix template.

```bash
$ x new grpc MyApp
```

Then from your new solution directory `MyApp`, mix in the Flutter application using:

```bash
$ x mix flutter-grpc
```

## Project Structure

The `x mix flutter-grpc` template uses your locally installed Flutter SDK to create the initial Flutter application via the `flutter create` command.
It then overrides some source files, and adds some required Dart dependencies to facilitate the integration with your gRPC services.

![](./img/pages/mix/flutter-mix-project-structure.png)

## Running

To develop on your Flutter client, it is best to take advantage of the hot reload functionality of both Flutter and `dotnet watch`.

### ServiceStack App

From your `grpc` project directory, navigate into your `MyApp` AppHost directory and run:

```bash
$ dotnet watch
```

The `grpc` template is pre-configured listening on 3 ports in the `appsettings.json`.

- `https://*:5001` - Http1 - Normal Web Service Access
- `https://*:5051` - Http2 - Grpc Secure
- `http://*:5054` - Http2 - Grpc Insecure

When developing locally, the Flutter client application accesses gRPC services using the `GrpcInsecure` endpoints using port `5054`.

Keep your services running, and open your `myapp_flutter` directory using [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/install).

ServiceStack [generates this `.proto`](./grpc#proto-options) file used by the client and then provides [tooling through the dotnet `x` tool to generate gRPC client code in Dart](/grpc#public-grpc-protoc-service-and-ui), or multiple other languages.

The Flutter client application itself uses Dart libraries like [`protobuf`](https://pub.dev/packages/protobuf) from Google, the [`grpc`](https://pub.dev/packages/grpc) from the Dart team and leverages the optimized [`servicestack` package](https://pub.dev/packages/servicestack) to improve the development experience.

Since your ServiceStack application host generates the `.proto` file, you can use any other standard gRPC tooling with this file if you prefer.

```dart
var host = "localhost";
var channel = ClientChannel(host, port:5054,
  options:const ChannelOptions(credentials: ChannelCredentials.insecure(
)));
var client = GrpcServicesClient(channel);

runApp(const MyApp());
```

### Calling the Hello API

The `callService` method is an `async` method where Dart has a familiar syntax to dotnet. The generated gRPC client in the 4 `services.*.dart` files is baked into the `fluter-grpc` mix template and contain the initially generated gRPC client.
Calling gRPC services using generated client is similar to using other ServiceStack service clients, but since it is gRPC, we have dedicated methods on our client for our services. Eg, `getHello` rather than just the verb `get`.

```dart
void callService() async {
  var text = myController.text.isEmpty ? "World" : myController.text;
  var response = await client.getHello(Hello(name: text));
  setState(() {
    result = response.result;
  });
}
```

### Updating your client DTOs

During development of your web services, when changes are made to your Request DTO classes, your client sometimes needs to be aware of these changes.
We can update both the `services.proto` file and generated Dart client using the ServiceStack dotnet `x` tool and the command:

```bash
$ x proto-dart https://localhost:5001
```

This command updates the `services.proto` file first, and then uses our [hosted gRPC client generator](https://grpc.servicestack.net) to generate a working gRPC client in the language of your choice.

The initial `services.*.dart` files contain a basic gRPC client for working with the default `Hello` service, but if other web services are running on your host application, using `x proto-dart` will then sync your client and generated client as you make changes.

For example, if you use one of our [Jamstack templates](https://jamstacks.net), and configure gRPC using `x mix grpc`, there is also a Todo service.

### Make your service support gRPC

For a ServiceStack service to support gRPC, it needs to use the `[DataContract]` and `[DataMember(Order = x)]` attributes on the types exposed by your generated clients. Once these attributes are added

```csharp
[Tag("todos")]
[Route("/todos", "GET")]
[DataContract]
public class QueryTodos : QueryData<Todo>
{
    [DataMember(Order = 1)]
    public int? Id { get; set; }
    [DataMember(Order = 2)]
    public List<long>? Ids { get; set; }
    [DataMember(Order = 3)]
    public string? TextContains { get; set; }
}

[DataContract]
public class Todo : IHasId<long>
{
    [DataMember(Order = 1)]
    public long Id { get; set; }
    [DataMember(Order = 2)]
    public string Text { get; set; }
    [DataMember(Order = 3)]
    public bool IsFinished { get; set; }
}
```

Once updated, re-running your ServiceStack application, we can update our generated gRPC client using `x proto-dart` from your project directory while your ServiceStack host is running locally.

This will enable you to integrate with the `Todo` service using the updated client using the following syntax.

```dart
Future<QueryResponse_Todo> queryTodos() async {
  return await client.getQueryTodos(QueryTodos());
}
```

gRPC's use of [Protocol Buffers does have a number of restrictions](/grpc#limitations) in the Types in supports that are worth keeping in mind.
