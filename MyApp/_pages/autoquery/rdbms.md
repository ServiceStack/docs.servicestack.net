title: AutoQuery RDBMS
---

AutoQuery RDBMS enables the rapid development of high-performance, fully-queryable typed RDBMS data-driven services with just a POCO Request DTO class definition and [supports most major RDBMS](/ormlite/#ormlite-rdbms-providers) courtesy of building on [OrmLite's high-performance RDBMS-agnostic API's](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.OrmLite).

### AutoQuery Services are ServiceStack Services

An important point to highlight is that AutoQuery Services are just normal ServiceStack Services, utilizing the same [Request Pipeline](/order-of-operations), which can be mapped to any [user-defined route](/routing), is available in all [registered formats](/formats) and can be [consumed from existing typed Service Clients](/clients-overview). 

In addition to leveraging ServiceStack's existing functionality, maximizing re-use in this way reduces the cognitive overhead required for developers who can re-use their existing knowledge in implementing, customizing, introspecting and consuming ServiceStack services. 

### Getting Started

Like ServiceStack's [other composable features](/plugins), the AutoQuery Feature is enabled by registering a Plugin, e.g:

```csharp
Plugins.Add(new AutoQueryFeature { MaxLimit = 100 });
```

Which is all that's needed to enable the AutoQuery feature. The AutoQueryFeature is inside [ServiceStack.Server](https://servicestack.net/download#get-started) NuGet package which contains value-added features that utilize either OrmLite and Redis which can be added to your project with:

:::copy
`<PackageReference Include="ServiceStack.Server" Version="8.*" />`
:::

If you don't have OrmLite configured it can be registered with a 1-liner by specifying your preferred DialectProvider and Connection String:

```csharp
container.Register<IDbConnectionFactory>(
    new OrmLiteConnectionFactory(":memory:", SqliteDialect.Provider));
```

The above config registers an In Memory Sqlite database although as the AutoQuery test suite works in all [supported RDBMS providers](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.OrmLite/#download) you're free to use your registered DB of choice.

The `MaxLimit` option ensures each query returns a maximum limit of **100** rows.

::: tip
It's recommended `MaxLimit` is set based on your own requirements as not setting a `MaxLimit` will return **all rows** for a query
:::

Now that everything's configured we can create our first service. To implement the ideal API for [OData's movie ratings query](/autoquery/why-not-odata) we just need to define the Request DTO for our service, i.e:

```csharp
[Route("/movies")]
public class FindMovies : QueryDb<Movie>
{
    public string[] Ratings { get; set; }
}
```

That's all the code needed! Which we can now call using the ideal route:

```
/movies?ratings=G,PG-13
```

### Clients continue to benefit from a typed API

and because it's a just regular Request DTO, we also get an end-to-end typed API for free with:

```csharp
var movies = client.Get(new FindMovies { Ratings = new[]{"G","PG-13"} })
```

Whilst that gives us the ideal API we want, the minimum code required is to just declare a new Request DTO with the table you wish to query:

```csharp
public class FindMovies : QueryDb<Movie> {}
```

Which just like other Request DTO's in ServiceStack falls back to using ServiceStack's [pre-defined routes](/routing#pre-defined-routes)

### IQuery

`QueryDb<T>` is just an abstract class that implements `IQuery<T>` and returns a typed `QueryResponse<T>`:

```csharp
public abstract class QueryDb<T> : QueryDb, 
    IQuery<T>, IReturn<QueryResponse<T>> { }

public interface IQuery
{
    int? Skip { get; set; }           // How many results to skip
    int? Take { get; set; }           // How many results to return
    string OrderBy { get; set; }      // List of fields to sort by
    string OrderByDesc { get; set; }  // List of fields to sort by descending
    string Include { get; set; }      // Aggregate queries to include
    string Fields { get; set; }       // The fields to return
}
```

The `IQuery` interface includes shared features that all Queries support and acts as a interface marker telling ServiceStack to create query services for each Request DTO. 

### Custom AutoQuery Implementations

The behavior of queries can be completely customized by simply providing your own Service implementation instead, e.g:

```csharp
// Override with custom implementation
public class MyQueryServices(IAutoQueryDb autoQuery) : Service
{
    // Sync
    public object Any(FindMovies query)
    {
        using var db = autoQuery.GetDb(query, base.Request);
        var q = autoQuery.CreateQuery(query, base.Request, db);
        return autoQuery.Execute(query, q, base.Request, db);
    }

    // Async
    public async Task<object> Any(QueryRockstars query)
    {
        using var db = autoQuery.GetDb(query, base.Request);
        var q = autoQuery.CreateQuery(query, base.Request, db);
        return await autoQuery.ExecuteAsync(query, q, base.Request, db);
    }
}
```

This is essentially what the AutoQuery feature generates for each `IQuery` Request DTO unless a Service for the Request DTO already exists, in which case it uses the existing implementation. 

We can inspect each line to understand how AutoQuery works:

Resolve the DB Connection for this AutoQuery request:

```csharp
using var db = AutoQuery.GetDb(query, base.Request);
```

By default this follows the [Multitenancy conventions](/multitenancy) for resolving a DB connection, which you can override with your 
own custom resolution for this service.

Creating a populated type SqlExpression:

```csharp
var q = AutoQuery.CreateQuery(query, base.Request, db);
```

Is an equivalent short-hand version for:

```csharp
Dictionary<string,string> queryArgs = Request.GetRequestParams();
var q = AutoQuery.CreateQuery(dto, queryArgs, Request, db);
```

Which constructs an [OrmLite SqlExpression](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.OrmLite/#examples) 
from typed properties on the Request DTO as well as any untyped key/value pairs on the HTTP Requests 
**QueryString** or **FormData**.

At this point you can inspect the SqlExpression that AutoQuery has constructed or append any additional custom criteria to limit the scope of the request like limiting results to the authenticated user.

After constructing the query from the Request all that's left is executing it:

```csharp
return AutoQuery.Execute(dto, q, Request);
```

As the implementation is trivial we can show the implementation inline:

```csharp
public QueryResponse<Into> Execute<Into>(
    IDbConnection db, ISqlExpression query)
{
    var q = (SqlExpression<From>)query;
    return new QueryResponse<Into>
    {
        Offset = q.Offset.GetValueOrDefault(0),
        Total = (int)db.Count(q),
        Results = db.LoadSelect<Into, From>(q),
    };
}
```

Basically just returns the results in an `QueryResponse<Into>` Response DTO. We also see that each query makes 2 requests, 1 for retrieving the total count for the query and another for the actual results, either limited by the request's `Skip` or `Take` or the configured `AutoQueryFeature.MaxLimit`.  

## Returning Custom Results

To specify returning results in a custom Response DTO you can inherit from the `QueryDb<From, Into>` convenience base class:

```csharp
public abstract class QueryDb<From, Into> 
    : QueryDb, IQuery<From, Into>, IReturn<QueryResponse<Into>> { }
```

As we can tell from the class definition this tells AutoQuery you want to query against `From` but return results into the specified `Into` type. This allows being able to return a curated set of columns, e.g:

```csharp
public class QueryCustomRockstars : QueryDb<Rockstar, CustomRockstar> {}

public class CustomRockstar
{
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }
    public int? Age { get; set; }
    public string RockstarAlbumName { get; set; }
}
```

In the example above we're returning only a subset of results. Unmatched properties like `RockstarAlbumName` are ignored enabling the re-use of custom DTO's for different queries.

## Returning Nested Related Results

AutoQuery also takes advantage of [OrmLite's References Support](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.OrmLite/#reference-support-poco-style) which lets you return related child records that are annotated with `[Reference]` attribute, e.g:

```csharp
public class QueryRockstars : QueryDb<Rockstar> {}

public class Rockstar
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }
    public int? Age { get; set; }

    [Reference]
    public List<RockstarAlbum> Albums { get; set; } 
}
```

## Joining Tables

AutoQuery lets us take advantage of OrmLite's recent [support for JOINs in typed SqlExpressions](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.OrmLite/#typed-sqlexpression-support-for-joins) 

We can tell AutoQuery to join on multiple tables using the `IJoin<T1,T2>` interface marker:

```csharp
public class QueryRockstarAlbums 
  : QueryDb<Rockstar,CustomRockstar>, IJoin<Rockstar,RockstarAlbum>
{
    public int? Age { get; set; }
    public string RockstarAlbumName { get; set; }
}
```

The above example tells AutoQuery to query against an **INNER JOIN** of the `Rockstar` and `RockstarAlbum` tables using [OrmLite's reference conventions](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.OrmLite/#reference-conventionst) that's implicit between both tables.

The Request DTO lets us query against fields across the joined tables where each field is matched with the [first table containing the field](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.OrmLite/#selecting-multiple-columns-across-joined-tables). You can match against fields using the fully qualified `{Table}{Field}` convention, e.g. `RockstarAlbumName` queries against the `RockstarAlbum`.`Name` column.

This mapping of fields also applies to the Response DTO where now `RockstarAlbumName` from the above `CustomRockstar` type will be populated:

```csharp
public class CustomRockstar
{
    ...
    public string RockstarAlbumName { get; set; }
}
```

### Joining multiple tables

Use the appropriate `Join<,>` generic interface to specify JOINs across multiple tables. AutoQuery supports joining up to 5 tables with 1 `Join<>` interface, e.g:

```csharp
IJoin<T1, T2, T3, T4, T5>
```

Or alternatively any number of tables can be joined together by annotating the Request DTO with multiple `IJoin<>` interfaces, e.g:

```csharp
IJoin<T1,T2>,
IJoin<T2,T3>,
IJoin<T3,T4>,
//...
```

### Support for LEFT JOINS

You can tell AutoQuery to use a **LEFT JOIN** by using the `ILeftJoin<,>` marker interface instead, e.g:

```csharp
public class QueryRockstarAlbumsLeftJoin : QueryDb<Rockstar, CustomRockstar>, 
    ILeftJoin<Rockstar, RockstarAlbum>
{
    public int? Age { get; set; }
    public string AlbumName { get; set; }
}
```

## Customizable Adhoc Queries

The queries up to this point showcase the default behavior of Request DTO fields performing an **Exact Match** using the `=` operand to match fields on queried tables. Advanced queries are available via configurable attributes illustrated in the example below which uses explicit templates to enable custom querying, e.g:

```csharp
public class QueryRockstars : QueryDb<Rockstar>
{
    //Defaults to 'AND FirstName = {Value}'
    public string FirstName { get; set; }  

    //Collections defaults to 'FirstName IN ({Values})'
    public string[] FirstNames { get; set; } 

    [QueryDbField(Operand = ">=")]
    public int? Age { get; set; }

    [QueryDbField(Template = "UPPER({Field}) LIKE UPPER({Value})", 
                Field = "FirstName")]
    public string FirstNameCaseInsensitive { get; set; }

    [QueryDbField(Template="{Field} LIKE {Value}", 
                Field="FirstName", ValueFormat="{0}%")]
    public string FirstNameStartsWith { get; set; }

    [QueryDbField(Template="{Field} LIKE {Value}", 
                Field="LastName", ValueFormat="%{0}")]
    public string LastNameEndsWith { get; set; }

    [QueryDbField(Template = "{Field} BETWEEN {Value1} AND {Value2}", 
                Field="FirstName")]
    public string[] FirstNameBetween { get; set; }

    [QueryDbField(Term = QueryTerm.Or)]
    public string LastName { get; set; }
}
```

We'll go through each of the examples to give a better idea of the customizations available.

### Queries on Collections

ServiceStack properties are case-insensitive and allows populating a collection with comma-delimited syntax, so this query:

```
/rockstars?firstNames=A,B,C
```

Will populate the string array:

```csharp
public string[] FirstNames { get; set; } 
```

That by default `IEnumerable` properties are queried using an SQL `{Field} IN ({Values})` template which will convert the string array into a quoted and escaped comma-delimited list of values suitable for use in SQL that looks like:

```sql
"FirstName" IN ('A','B','C')
```

The `{Field}` property is substituted according to the OrmLite FieldDefinition it matches, which for a Joined table with an `[Alias("FName")]` attribute would substitute to a fully-qualified name, e.g: `"Table"."FName"`

AutoQuerying also supports pluralized versions by trimming the `s` off Field names as a fall-back which is how `FirstNames` was able to match the `FirstName` table property.

### Customizable Operands

One of the easiest customization's available is changing the operand used in the query, e.g:

```csharp 
[QueryDbField(Operand = ">=")]
public int? Age { get; set; }
```

Will change how the Age is compared to:

```sql
"Age" >= {Value}
```

### Customizable Templates

By providing a customized template  even greater customization achieved and by sticking with TSQL compatible fragments will ensure it's supported by every RDBMS provider, e.g: 

```csharp
[QueryDbField(Template = "UPPER({Field}) LIKE UPPER({Value})",
            Field="FirstName")]
public string FirstNameCaseInsensitive { get; set; }
```

As noted above `{Field}` variable place holder is substituted with the qualified Table field whilst `{Value}` gets quoted and escaped to prevent SQL Injections.

The `Field="FirstName"` tells AutoQuery to ignore the property name and use the specified field name.

### Formatting Values

You can use the `ValueFormat` modifier to insert custom characters within the quoted `{Value}` placeholder which we use to insert the `%` wildcard in with the quoted value enabling StartsWith and EndsWith queries, e.g:

```csharp
[QueryDbField(Template="{Field} LIKE {Value}", 
            Field="FirstName", ValueFormat="{0}%")]
public string FirstNameStartsWith { get; set; }

[QueryDbField(Template="{Field} LIKE {Value}", 
            Field="LastName", ValueFormat="%{0}")]
public string LastNameEndsWith { get; set; }
```

### Specifying Multi Airity Queries

An alternate way to format multiple values is to use `Value{N}` variable placeholders which allows supporting statements with multiple values like SQL's **BETWEEN** statement:

```csharp
[QueryDbField(Template = "{Field} BETWEEN {Value1} AND {Value2}", 
            Field = "FirstName")]
public string[] FirstNameBetween { get; set; }
```

### Changing Querying Behavior

By default queries act like a filter and every condition is combined with **AND** boolean term to further filter the result-set. This can be changed to use an **OR** at the field-level by specifying `Term=QueryTerm.Or` modifier, e.g:

```csharp
[QueryDbField(Term=QueryTerm.Or)]
public string LastName { get; set; }
```

However as your API's should strive to [retain the same behavior and call-semantics](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15927475/servicestack-request-dto-design/15941229#15941229) the recommendation is to instead change the behavior at the API-level so that each property maintains consistent behavior, e.g:

```csharp
[QueryDb(QueryTerm.Or)]
public class QueryRockstars : QueryDb<Rockstar>
{
    public int[] Ids { get; set; }
    public List<int> Ages { get; set; }
    public List<string> FirstNames { get; set; }
}
```

In this example each property is inclusive where every value specified is added to the returned result-set. 

### Dynamic Attributes

Whilst .NET attributes are normally defined with the property they attribute, ServiceStack also allows attributes to be added dynamically allowing them to be defined elsewhere, detached from the DTO's, e.g:

```csharp
typeof(QueryRockstars)
    .GetProperty("Age")
    .AddAttributes(new QueryDbFieldAttribute { Operand = ">=" });
```

## Implicit Conventions

The examples above show how we can define adhoc **explicit** queries on concrete properties using explicit attributes. Whilst this was necessary to understand how to create customized queries, the concrete properties and explicit attributes can be avoided entirely by utilizing the built-in conventions, configurable on the `AutoQueryFeature` plugin.

With implicit conventions we can get back to defining Request DTO's with an empty body:

```csharp
public class QueryRockstars : QueryDb<Rockstar> {}
```

The built-in conventions allow using convention-based naming to query fields with expected behavior using self-describing properties. To explore this in more detail lets look at what built-in conventions are defined:

```csharp
const string GreaterThanOrEqualFormat = "{Field} >= {Value}";
const string GreaterThanFormat =        "{Field} >  {Value}";
const string LessThanFormat =           "{Field} <  {Value}";
const string LessThanOrEqualFormat =    "{Field} <= {Value}";
const string NotEqualFormat =           "{Field} <> {Value}";
const string IsNull =                   "{Field} IS NULL";
const string IsNotNull =                "{Field} IS NOT NULL";

ImplicitConventions = new Dictionary<string, string> 
{
    {"%Above%",         GreaterThanFormat},
    {"Begin%",          GreaterThanFormat},
    {"%Beyond%",        GreaterThanFormat},
    {"%Over%",          GreaterThanFormat},
    {"%OlderThan",      GreaterThanFormat},
    {"%After%",         GreaterThanFormat},
    {"OnOrAfter%",      GreaterThanOrEqualFormat},
    {"%From%",          GreaterThanOrEqualFormat},
    {"Since%",          GreaterThanOrEqualFormat},
    {"Start%",          GreaterThanOrEqualFormat},
    {"%Higher%",        GreaterThanOrEqualFormat},
    {">%",              GreaterThanOrEqualFormat},
    {"%>",              GreaterThanFormat},
    {"%!",              NotEqualFormat},
    {"<>%",             NotEqualFormat},

    {"%GreaterThanOrEqualTo%", GreaterThanOrEqualFormat},
    {"%GreaterThan%",          GreaterThanFormat},
    {"%LessThan%",             LessThanFormat},
    {"%LessThanOrEqualTo%",    LessThanOrEqualFormat},
    {"%NotEqualTo",            NotEqualFormat},

    {"Behind%",         LessThanFormat},
    {"%Below%",         LessThanFormat},
    {"%Under%",         LessThanFormat},
    {"%Lower%",         LessThanFormat},
    {"%Before%",        LessThanFormat},
    {"%YoungerThan",    LessThanFormat},
    {"OnOrBefore%",     LessThanOrEqualFormat},
    {"End%",            LessThanOrEqualFormat},
    {"Stop%",           LessThanOrEqualFormat},
    {"To%",             LessThanOrEqualFormat},
    {"Until%",          LessThanOrEqualFormat},
    {"%<",              LessThanOrEqualFormat},
    {"<%",              LessThanFormat},

    {"Like%",           "UPPER({Field}) LIKE UPPER({Value})"},
    {"%In",             "{Field} IN ({Values})"},
    {"%Ids",            "{Field} IN ({Values})"},
    {"%Between%",       "{Field} BETWEEN {Value1} AND {Value2}"},

    {"%HasAll",         "{Value} & {Field} = {Value}"},
    {"%HasAny",         "{Value} & {Field} > 0"},
            
    {"%IsNull",         IsNull},
    {"%IsNotNull",      IsNotNull},
};

EndsWithConventions = new Dictionary<string, QueryDbFieldAttribute>
{
    { "StartsWith", new QueryDbFieldAttribute { 
          Template= "UPPER({Field}) LIKE UPPER({Value})", 
          ValueFormat= "{0}%" }},
    { "Contains", new QueryDbFieldAttribute { 
          Template= "UPPER({Field}) LIKE UPPER({Value})", 
          ValueFormat= "%{0}%" }},
    { "EndsWith", new QueryDbFieldAttribute { 
          Template= "UPPER({Field}) LIKE UPPER({Value})", 
          ValueFormat= "%{0}" }},
};
```

The string key in the above dictionaries describe what property each rule maps to. We'll run through a few examples to see how we can make use of them:

The request below works as you would expect in returning all Rockstars older than 42 years of age.

```
/rockstars?AgeOlderThan=42
```

It works by matching on the rule since `AgeOlderThan` does indeed ends with `OlderThan`:

```csharp
{"%OlderThan", "{Field} > {Value}"},
```

The `%` wildcard is a placeholder for the field name which resolves to `Age`. Now that it has a match it creates a query with the defined `{Field} > {Value}` template to achieve the desired behavior.

If you instead wanted to use the inclusive `>=` operand, we can just use a rule with the `>=` template:

```
/rockstars?AgeGreaterThanOrEqualTo=42
```

Which matches the rule:

```csharp
{"%GreaterThanOrEqualTo%", "{Field} >= {Value}"},
```

And when the wildcard is on both ends of the pattern:

```csharp
{"%GreaterThan%", "{Field} > {Value}"},
```

So to can the field name, which matches both these rules:

```
/rockstars?AgeGreaterThan=42
/rockstars?GreaterThanAge=42
```

An alternative to using wordy suffixes are the built-in short-hand syntax:

| Param | Behavior |
|-|-|
|**>Age**|`Age >= {Value}`|
|**Age>**|`Age  > {Value}`|
|**<Age**|`Age  < {Value}`|
|**Age<**|`Age <= {Value}`|

Which uses the appropriate operand based on whether the `<` `>` operators come before or after the field name:

```
/rockstars?>Age=42
/rockstars?Age>=42
/rockstars?<Age=42
/rockstars?Age<=42
```

The use of `{Values}` or the `Value{N}` formats specifies the query should be treated as a collection, e.g:

```csharp
{"%Ids",       "{Field} IN ({Values})"},
{"%In",        "{Field} IN ({Values})"},
{"%Between%",  "{Field} BETWEEN {Value1} AND {Value2}"},
```

Which allows multiple values to be specified on the QueryString:

```
/rockstars?Ids=1,2,3
/rockstars?FirstNamesIn=Jim,Kurt
/rockstars?FirstNameBetween=A,F
```

### Advanced Conventions

More advanced conventions can be specified directly on the `StartsWithConventions` and `EndsWithConventions` dictionaries which allow customizations using the full `[QueryDbField]` attribute, e.g:

```csharp
EndsWithConventions = new Dictionary<string, QueryDbFieldAttribute>
{
    { "StartsWith", new QueryDbFieldAttribute { 
          Template = "UPPER({Field}) LIKE UPPER({Value})", 
          ValueFormat = "{0}%" }},
    { "Contains", new QueryDbFieldAttribute { 
          Template = "UPPER({Field}) LIKE UPPER({Value})", 
          ValueFormat = "%{0}%" }},
    { "EndsWith", new QueryDbFieldAttribute { 
          Template = "UPPER({Field}) LIKE UPPER({Value})", 
          ValueFormat = "%{0}" }},
};
```

that can be called as normal:

```
/rockstars?FirstNameStartsWith=Jim
/rockstars?LastNameEndsWith=son
/rockstars?RockstarAlbumNameContains=e
```

This also shows that Implicit Conventions can also apply to joined table fields like `RockstarAlbumNameContains` using the fully qualified `{Table}{Field}` reference convention.

## Explicit Conventions

Whilst Implicit conventions can be called on an empty "contract-less" DTO, you're also able to specify the concrete properties for the conventions you end up using: 

```csharp
public class QueryRockstars : QueryDb<Rockstar>
{
    public int? AgeOlderThan { get; set; }
    public int? AgeGreaterThanOrEqualTo { get; set; }
    public int? AgeGreaterThan { get; set; }
    public int? GreaterThanAge { get; set; }
    public string FirstNameStartsWith { get; set; }
    public string LastNameEndsWith { get; set; }
    public string LastNameContains { get; set; }
    public string RockstarAlbumNameContains { get; set; }
    public int? RockstarIdAfter { get; set; }
    public int? RockstarIdOnOrAfter { get; set; }
}
```

### Preemptive client requests

A hidden gem in AutoQuery's approach that's not immediately obvious is how everything will still work when concrete properties are only added to client Request DTO's that the server doesn't even know about yet! This is possible as the service client generates the same HTTP Request that matches the implicit conventions, making it possible to perform new preemptive typed queries on the client without having to redeploy the server. Although unlikely to be a popular use-case given that in most cases the client and server shares the same DTOs, it's a nice surprise feature when needed.

### Advantages of well-defined Service Contracts

The advantages of formalizing the conventions you end up using is that they can be consumed with ServiceStack's [Typed Service Clients](/csharp-client):

```csharp
var response = client.Get(new QueryRockstars { AgeOlderThan = 42 });
```

As well as making your API self-describing and gives you access to all of ServiceStack's metadata services including:

 - [Metadata pages](/metadata-page)
 - [Open API](/openapi)
 - [Postman Support](/postman)

Which is why we recommend formalizing your conventions you want to allow before deploying your API to production. 

When publishing your API, you can also assert that only explicit conventions are ever used by disabling untyped implicit conventions support with:

```csharp
Plugins.Add(new AutoQueryFeature { EnableUntypedQueries = false });
```

## Raw SQL Filters

It's also possible to specify Raw SQL Filters. Whilst offering greater flexibility they also suffer from many of the problems that OData's expressions have. 

Raw SQL Filters also don't benefit from limiting matching to declared fields and auto-escaping and quoting of values although they're still validated against OrmLite's [IllegalSqlFragmentTokens](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.OrmLite/blob/master/src/ServiceStack.OrmLite/OrmLiteUtilExtensions.cs#L172) to protect against SQL Injection attacks. But as they still allow calling SQL Functions, Raw SqlFilters shouldn't be enabled when accessible by untrusted parties unless they've been configured to use a [Named OrmLite DB Connection](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.OrmLite/#multi-nested-database-connections) which is read-only and locked-down so that it only has access to what it's allowed to.

If safe to do so, RawSqlFilters can be enabled with:

```csharp
Plugins.Add(new AutoQueryFeature { 
    EnableRawSqlFilters = true,
    UseNamedConnection = "readonly",
    IllegalSqlFragmentTokens = { "ProtectedSqlFunction" },
});
```

Once enabled you can use the `_select`, `_from`, `_where` modifiers to append custom SQL Fragments, e.g:

```
/rockstars?_select=FirstName,LastName

/rockstars?_where=Age > 42
/rockstars?_where=FirstName LIKE 'Jim%'

/rockstars?_select=FirstName&_where=LastName = 'Cobain'

/rockstars?_from=Rockstar r INNER JOIN RockstarAlbum a ON r.Id = a.RockstarId
```

::: info
url encoding in the above examples are omitted for readability

Whilst Raw SqlFilters affect the query executed, they don't change what Response DTO is returned.

## Custom Fields

You can also customize which fields you want returned using the `Fields` property available on all AutoQuery Services, e.g:

```
?Fields=Id,Name,Description,JoinTableId
```

The Fields still need to be defined on the Response DTO as this feature doesn't change the Response
DTO Schema, only which fields are populated. This does change the underlying RDBMS SELECT that's executed, 
also benefiting from reduced bandwidth between your RDBMS and App Server.

A useful [JSON customization](/customize-json-responses) 
that you can add when specifying custom fields is `ExcludeDefaultValues`, e.g:

```
/query?Fields=Id,Name,Description,JoinTableId&jsconfig=ExcludeDefaultValues
```

### Wildcards

You can use **wildcards** to quickly reference all fields on a table using the `table.*` format, e.g:

```
?fields=id,departmentid,department,employee.*
```

Which is a shorthand that expands to manually listing each field in the `Employee` table, useful for queries 
which joins multiple tables, e.g:

```csharp
[Route("/employees", "GET")]
public class QueryEmployees : QueryDb<Employee>,
    IJoin<Employee, EmployeeType>,
    IJoin<Employee, Department>,
    IJoin<Employee, Title> 
{
    //...
}
```

### DISTINCT Custom Fields

To query only results with distinct fields you can prefix the custom fields list with `DISTINCT `, e.g

Using QueryString:

```
?Fields=DISTINCT City,Country
```

Using C# Client:

```csharp
var response = client.Get(new QueryCustomers { 
    Fields = "DISTINCT City,Country"
})
```

We can use this feature with Northwind's existing [AutoQuery Request DTOs](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/Northwind/blob/master/src/Northwind.ServiceModel/AutoQuery.cs):

```csharp
[Route("/query/customers")]
public class QueryCustomers : QueryDb<Customer> { }
```

To return all unique City and Countries of Northwind Customers with:

 - [northwind.netcore.io/query/customers?Fields=DISTINCT City,Country](https://northwind.netcore.io/query/customers?Fields=DISTINCT%20City,Country)

Or to just return their unique Countries they're in:

 - [northwind.netcore.io/query/customers?Fields=DISTINCT Country](https://northwind.netcore.io/query/customers?Fields=DISTINCT%20Country)

## Paging and Ordering

Some functionality defined on the core `IQuery` interface and available to all queries is the ability to page and order results:

```csharp
public interface IQuery
{
    int? Skip { get; set; }
    int? Take { get; set; }
    string OrderBy { get; set; }
    string OrderByDesc { get; set; }
}
```

This works as you would expect where you can modify the returned result set with:

```
/rockstars?skip=10&take=20&orderBy=Id
```

Or when accessing via a ServiceClient:

```csharp
client.Get(new QueryRockstars { Skip=10, Take=20, OrderBy="Id" });
``` 

When results are paged an implicit OrderBy is added using the PrimaryKey of the `IQuery<Table>` to ensure predictable ordering of results are returned. You can change the OrderBy used by specifying your own: 

```csharp
client.Get(new QueryRockstars { Skip=10, Take=20, OrderByDesc="Id" });
``` 

Or remove the default behavior with:

```csharp
Plugins.Add(new AutoQueryFeature { 
    OrderByPrimaryKeyOnPagedQuery = false 
});
```

### Multiple OrderBy's

AutoQuery also supports specifying multiple OrderBy's with a comma-delimited list of field names, e.g:

```
/rockstars?orderBy=Id,Age,FirstName
```

Same request via Service Client:

```csharp
client.Get(new QueryRockstars { OrderBy = "Id,Age,FirstName" });
```

#### Sort specific fields in reverse order

When specifying multiple order by's you can sort specific fields in reverse order by prepending a `-` before the field name, e.g:

```
?orderBy=Id,-Age,FirstName
?orderByDesc=-Id,Age,-FirstName
```

### OrderBy Random

`OrderBy` includes special support for returning results in Random order using `Random`, e.g:

```
/rockstars?OrderBy=Random
```

Using Service Client:

```csharp
client.Get(new QueryRockstars { OrderBy = "Random" });
``` 

## Service Clients Support

One of the major benefits of using Typed DTO's to define your Service Contract is that it allows usage of ServiceStack's [.NET Service Clients](/csharp-client) which enables an end-to-end API without code-gen for [most .NET and PCL client platforms](https://github.com/ServiceStack/Hello). 

With the richer semantics available in queries, we've been able to enhance the Service Clients new `GetLazy()` API that allows lazy streaming of responses to provide transparent paging of large result-sets, e.g:

```csharp
var results = client.GetLazy(new QueryMovies { 
    Ratings = new[]{"G","PG-13"}
}).ToList();
```

Since GetLazy returns a lazy `IEnumerable<T>` sequence it can also be used within LINQ expressions, e.g:

```csharp
var top250 = client.GetLazy(new QueryMovies { 
        Ratings = new[]{ "G", "PG-13" } 
    })
    .Take(250)
    .ConvertTo(x => x.Title);
```

## Mime Types and Content-Negotiation

Another benefit we get from AutoQuery Services being regular ServiceStack services is taking advantage of [ServiceStack's built-in formats](/formats). 

### CSV Format

The [CSV Format](/csv-format) especially shines here given queries return a single tabular resultset making it perfect for CSV. In many ways CSV is one of the most interoperable Data Formats given most data import and manipulation programs including Databases and Spreadsheets have native support for CSV allowing for deep and seamless integration.

ServiceStack provides a number of ways to [request your preferred content-type](/routing#content-negotiation), the easiest of which is to just use the `.{format}` extension at the end of the `/pathinfo` e.g:

```
/rockstars.csv
/movies.csv?ratings=G,PG-13
```

[CSV Format](/csv-format) responses can use the same [scoped custom responses as JSON](/customize-json-responses) to allow
Typed Results to exclude default values columns when returning limited [custom fields with `?fields`](/autoquery/rdbms#custom-fields):

 - Camel Humps Notation: `?jsconfig=edv`
 - Full configuration: `?jsconfig=ExcludeDefaultValues`

### JSONL Format

whilst the [JSON Lines Format](/jsonl-format) is useful for returning results in a streamable JSON format:

```
/rockstars.jsonl
/movies.jsonl?ratings=G,PG-13
```

## Named Connection

AutoQuery can also easily be configured to query any number of different databases registered in your AppHost. 

In the example below we configure our main RDBMS to use SQL Server and register a **Named Connection** 
to point to a **Reporting** PostgreSQL RDBMS:

```csharp
var dbFactory = new OrmLiteConnectionFactory(connString, SqlServer2012Dialect.Provider);
container.Register<IDbConnectionFactory>(dbFactory);

dbFactory.RegisterConnection("Reporting", pgConnString, PostgreSqlDialect.Provider);
```

Any normal AutoQuery Services like `QueryOrders` will use the default SQL Server connection whilst 
`QuerySales` will execute its query on the PostgreSQL `Reporting` Database instead:

```csharp
public class QueryOrders : QueryDb<Order> {}

[ConnectionInfo(NamedConnection = "Reporting")]
public class QuerySales : QueryDb<Sales> {}
```

An alternative to specifying the `[ConnectionInfo]` Request Filter Attribute on the AutoQuery Request DTO, is to specify the named connection on the **POCO Table** instead, e.g:

```csharp
[NamedConnection("Reporting")]
public class Sales { ... }

public class QuerySales : QueryDb<Sales> {}
```

## Include Aggregates in AutoQuery

AutoQuery supports running additional Aggregate queries on the queried result-set. To include aggregates in your Query's response specify them in the `Include` property of your AutoQuery Request DTO, e.g:

```cs
var response = client.Get(new QueryRockstars { Include = "COUNT(*)" })
```

Or in the `Include` QueryString param if you're calling AutoQuery Services from a browser, e.g:

```
/rockstars?include=COUNT(*)
```

The result is then published in the `QueryResponse<T>.Meta` String Dictionary and is accessible with:

```
response.Meta["COUNT(*)"] //= 7
```

By default any of the functions in the SQL Aggregate whitelist can be referenced: 

```
AVG, COUNT, FIRST, LAST, MAX, MIN, SUM
```

Which can be added to or removed from by modifying `SqlAggregateFunctions` collection, e.g, you can allow usage of a `CustomAggregate` SQL Function with:

```cs
Plugins.Add(new AutoQueryFeature { 
    SqlAggregateFunctions = { "CustomAggregate" }
})
```

### Aggregate Query Usage

The syntax for aggregate functions is modelled after their usage in SQL so they're instantly familiar. At its most basic usage you can just specify the name of the aggregate function which will use `*` as a default argument so you can also query `COUNT(*)` with: 

```
?include=COUNT
```

It also supports SQL aliases:

```
COUNT(*) Total
COUNT(*) as Total
```

Which is used to change what key the result is saved into:

```cs
response.Meta["Total"]
```

Columns can be referenced by name:

```
COUNT(LivingStatus)
```

If an argument matches a column in the primary table the literal reference is used as-is, if it matches a column in a joined table it's replaced with its fully-qualified reference and when it doesn't match any column, Numbers are passed as-is otherwise its automatically escaped and quoted and passed in as a string literal.

The `DISTINCT` modifier can also be used, so a complex example looks like:

```
COUNT(DISTINCT LivingStatus) as UniqueStatus
```

Which saves the result of the above function in:

```cs
response.Meta["UniqueStatus"]
```

Any number of aggregate functions can be combined in a comma-delimited list:

```
Count(*) Total, Min(Age), AVG(Age) AverageAge
```

Which returns results in:

```cs
response.Meta["Total"]
response.Meta["Min(Age)"]
response.Meta["AverageAge"]
```

### Include Total

The total records available for a query can be included in the Response by adding it on the QueryString, e.g:

```
/query?Include=Total
```

Or on the Request DTO:

```csharp
var response = client.Get(new MyQuery { Include = "Total" });
```

Alternatively you can always have the Total returned in every request with:

```csharp
Plugins.Add(new AutoQueryFeature {
    IncludeTotal = true
})
```

#### Aggregate Query Performance

AutoQuery combines all other aggregate functions like `Total` and executes them in the same a single query for optimal performance.

### Hybrid AutoQuery Services

AutoQuery Services can be easily enhanced by creating a custom Service implementation that modifies the `SqlExpression` Query that AutoQuery auto populates from the incoming request. In addition to using OrmLite's typed API to perform standard DB queries you can also take advantage of advanced RDBMS features with custom SQL fragments. As an example we'll look at the implementation of [techstacks.io](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/TechStacks) fundamental 
[QueryPosts Service](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/TechStacks/blob/master/src/TechStacks.ServiceInterface/PostPublicServices.cs) 
which powers every Post feed in TechStacks where its custom implementation inherits all queryable functionality of its `QueryDb<Post>` AutoQuery Service and adds high-level functionality for `AnyTechnologyIds` and `Is` custom high-level properties that's used to query multiple columns behind-the-scenes.

In addition to inheriting all default Querying functionality in a `QueryDb<Post>` AutoQuery Service, the custom implementation also:

 - Prevents returning any `Deleted` Posts
 - Prevents returning any posts with a `closed` status unless the query specifically targets a closed label or status
 - Avoids any table joins by using PostgreSQL advanced Array data type for querying post `string` **labels** or `int` **technology ids**
 - Uses `AnyTechnologyIds` to return any posts **tagged with** the specified technologies

```csharp
[Route("/posts", "GET")]
public class QueryPosts : QueryDb<Post>
{
    // Handled by AutoQuery
    public int[] Ids { get; set; }
    public int? OrganizationId { get; set; }
    public int[] OrganizationIds { get; set; }
    public string[] Types { get; set; }

    // Handled by Custom Implementation
    public int[] AnyTechnologyIds { get; set; }
    public string[] Is { get; set; }
}

[CacheResponse(Duration = 600)]
public class PostPublicServices(IAutoQueryDb autoQuery) : Service
{
    public object Any(QueryPosts request)
    {
        using var db = autoQuery.GetDb(query, base.Request);
        var q = autoQuery.CreateQuery(query, base.Request, db) //Populated SqlExpression

        q.Where(x => x.Deleted == null);
        
        var states = request.Is ?? TypeConstants.EmptyStringArray;
        if (states.Contains("closed") || states.Contains("completed") || states.Contains("declined"))
            q.And(x => x.Status == "closed");
        else
            q.And(x => x.Hidden == null && (x.Status == null || x.Status != "closed"));

        if (states.Length > 0)
        {
            var labelSlugs = states.Where(x => x != "closed" && x != "open")
                .Map(x => x.GenerateSlug());
            if (labelSlugs.Count > 0)
                q.And($"{PgSql.Array(labelSlugs)} && labels");
        }

        if (!request.AnyTechnologyIds.IsEmpty())
        {
            q.And($"{PgSql.Array(request.AnyTechnologyIds)} && technology_ids");
        }

        return AutoQuery.Execute(request, q, base.Request);
    }
}
```

The above implementation also caches all `QueryPosts` responses as a result of being defined in a Service annotated with [`[CacheResponse]` attribute](/cacheresponse-attribute).

### IAutoQueryDb API

To increase the versatility of using AutoQuery functionality in custom Service implementations, `IAutoQueryDb` supports both parallel Sync and Async APIs 
if needing to enlist AutoQuery functionality in Sync methods that are unable to be refactored to use the async APIs:

```csharp
public interface IAutoQueryDb : IAutoCrudDb
{
    // Generic API to resolve the DB Connection to use for this request
    IDbConnection GetDb<From>(IRequest req = null);

    // Generate a populated and Typed OrmLite SqlExpression using same model as the source and output target
    SqlExpression<From> CreateQuery<From>(IQueryDb<From> dto, Dictionary<string, string> dynamicArgs,
        IRequest req = null, IDbConnection db = null);

    // Execute an OrmLite SqlExpression using the same model as the source and output target
    QueryResponse<From> Execute<From>(IQueryDb<From> model, SqlExpression<From> query, 
        IRequest req = null, IDbConnection db = null);

    // Async Execute an OrmLite SqlExpression using the same model as the source and output target
    Task<QueryResponse<From>> ExecuteAsync<From>(IQueryDb<From> model, SqlExpression<From> query, 
        IRequest req = null, IDbConnection db = null);

    // Generate a populated and Typed OrmLite SqlExpression using different models for source & output target
    SqlExpression<From> CreateQuery<From,Into>(IQueryDb<From,Into> dto, Dictionary<string,string> dynamicArgs,
        IRequest req = null, IDbConnection db = null);

    // Execute an OrmLite SqlExpression using different models for source and output target
    QueryResponse<Into> Execute<From, Into>(IQueryDb<From,Into> model, SqlExpression<From> query, 
        IRequest req = null, IDbConnection db = null);

    // Async Execute an OrmLite SqlExpression using different models for source and output target
    Task<QueryResponse<Into>> ExecuteAsync<From, Into>(IQueryDb<From,Into> model, SqlExpression<From> query, 
        IRequest req = null, IDbConnection db = null);
}
```

The `IAutoQueryDb` inherits `IAutoCrudDb` APIs below and can access both AutoQuery and CRUD functionality.

Likewise the new AutoQuery Crud APIs also have sync & async implementations:

```csharp
public interface IAutoCrudDb
{
    // Inserts new entry into Table
    object Create<Table>(ICreateDb<Table> dto, IRequest req);
    
    // Inserts new entry into Table Async
    Task<object> CreateAsync<Table>(ICreateDb<Table> dto, IRequest req);
    
    // Updates entry into Table
    object Update<Table>(IUpdateDb<Table> dto, IRequest req);
    
    // Updates entry into Table Async
    Task<object> UpdateAsync<Table>(IUpdateDb<Table> dto, IRequest req);
    
    // Partially Updates entry into Table (Uses OrmLite UpdateNonDefaults behavior)
    object Patch<Table>(IPatchDb<Table> dto, IRequest req);
    
    // Partially Updates entry into Table Async (Uses OrmLite UpdateNonDefaults behavior)
    Task<object> PatchAsync<Table>(IPatchDb<Table> dto, IRequest req);
    
    // Deletes entry from Table
    object Delete<Table>(IDeleteDb<Table> dto, IRequest req);
    
    // Deletes entry from Table Async
    Task<object> DeleteAsync<Table>(IDeleteDb<Table> dto, IRequest req);

    // Inserts or Updates entry into Table
    object Save<Table>(ISaveDb<Table> dto, IRequest req);

    // Inserts or Updates entry into Table Async
    Task<object> SaveAsync<Table>(ISaveDb<Table> dto, IRequest req);
}
```

Due to its internal pre-defined behavior, AutoQuery CRUD custom Service implementations have limited customizability over its implementation but still allows you to apply custom logic like apply Custom Filter Attributes, include additional validation, augment the Response DTO, etc.

E.g. This implementation applies the `[ConnectionInfo]` behavior to all its Services which will instead execute queries on the registered Reporting named connection:

```csharp
[ConnectionInfo(NamedConnection = "Reporting")]
public class MyReportingServices(IAutoQueryDb autoQuery) : Service
{
    public Task<object> Any(CreateReport request) => autoQuery.CreateAsync(request,base.Request);
}
```

### AutoQuery Response Filters

The Aggregate functions feature is built on the new `ResponseFilters` support in AutoQuery which provides a new extensibility option enabling customization and additional metadata to be attached to AutoQuery Responses. As the Aggregate Functions support is itself a Response Filter in can disabled by clearing them:

```csharp
Plugins.Add(new AutoQueryFeature {
    ResponseFilters = new List<Action<QueryFilterContext>>()
})
```

The Response Filters are executed after each AutoQuery and gets passed the full context of the executed query, i.e:

```csharp
class QueryFilterContext
{
    IDbConnection Db             // The ADO.NET DB Connection
    List<Command> Commands       // Tokenized list of commands
    IQuery Request               // The AutoQuery Request DTO
    ISqlExpression SqlExpression // The AutoQuery SqlExpression
    IQueryResponse Response      // The AutoQuery Response DTO
}
```

Where the `Commands` property contains the parsed list of commands from the `Include` property, tokenized into the structure below:

```csharp
class Command 
{
    string Name
    List<string> Args
    string Suffix
}
```

With this we could add basic calculator functionality to AutoQuery with the custom Response Filter below:

```csharp
Plugins.Add(new AutoQueryFeature {
    ResponseFilters = {
        ctx => {
            var supportedFns = new Dictionary<string, Func<int, int, int>>(StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase)
            {
                {"ADD",      (a,b) => a + b },
                {"MULTIPLY", (a,b) => a * b },
                {"DIVIDE",   (a,b) => a / b },
                {"SUBTRACT", (a,b) => a - b },
            };
            var executedCmds = new List<Command>();
            foreach (var cmd in ctx.Commands)
            {
                Func<int, int, int> fn;
                if (!supportedFns.TryGetValue(cmd.Name, out fn)) continue;
                var label = !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(cmd.Suffix) ? cmd.Suffix.Trim() : cmd.ToString();
                ctx.Response.Meta[label] = fn(int.Parse(cmd.Args[0]), int.Parse(cmd.Args[1])).ToString();
                executedCmds.Add(cmd);
            }
            ctx.Commands.RemoveAll(executedCmds.Contains);
        }        
    }
})
```

Which now lets users perform multiple basic arithmetic operations with any AutoQuery request!

```csharp
var response = client.Get(new QueryRockstars {
    Include = "ADD(6,2), Multiply(6,2) SixTimesTwo, Subtract(6,2), divide(6,2) TheDivide"
});

response.Meta["ADD(6,2)"]      //= 8
response.Meta["SixTimesTwo"]   //= 12
response.Meta["Subtract(6,2)"] //= 4
response.Meta["TheDivide"]     //= 3
```

### Untyped SqlExpression

If you need to introspect or modify the executed `ISqlExpression`, it’s useful to access it as a `IUntypedSqlExpression` so its non-generic API's are still accessible without having to convert it back into its concrete generic `SqlExpression<T>` Type, e.g:

```csharp
IUntypedSqlExpression q = ctx.SqlExpression.GetUntypedSqlExpression()
    .Clone();
```

::: info
Cloning the SqlExpression allows you to modify a copy that won't affect any other Response Filter.
:::

### AutoQuery Property Mapping

AutoQuery can map `[DataMember]` property aliases on Request DTO's to the queried table, e.g:

```csharp
public class QueryPerson : QueryDb<Person>
{
    [DataMember(Name = "first_name")]
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
}

public class Person
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }
}
```

Which can be queried with:

```
?first_name=Jimi
```

or by setting the global `JsConfig.Init(Config { TextCase = TextCase.SnakeCase })` convention:

```csharp
public class QueryPerson : QueryDb<Person>
{
    public string LastName { get; set; }
}
```

Where it's also queryable with:

```
?last_name=Hendrix
```

## Extensibility with QueryFilters

We've already covered some of extensibility options with Customizable **QueryDbFields** and **Implicit Conventions**, the most customizable would be to override the default implementation with a custom one, e.g:

```csharp
public class MyQueryServices(IAutoQueryDb autoQuery) : Service
{
    //Override with custom implementation
    public object Any(FindMovies dto)
    {
        var q = autoQuery.CreateQuery(dto, Request.GetRequestParams(), base.Request);
        return autoQuery.Execute(dto, q, base.Request);
    }
}
```

There's also a lighter weight option by registering a typed Query Filter, e.g:

```csharp
var autoQuery = new AutoQueryFeature()
  .RegisterQueryFilter<QueryRockstarsFilter, Rockstar>((q, dto, req) =>
      q.And(x => x.LastName.EndsWith("son"))
  )
  .RegisterQueryFilter<IFilterRockstars, Rockstar>((q, dto, req) =>
      q.And(x => x.LastName.EndsWith("son"))
  );

Plugins.Add(autoQuery);
```

Registering an interface like `IFilterRockstars` is especially useful as it enables applying custom logic to a number of different Query Services sharing the same interface. 

## Intercept and Introspect Every Query

As mentioned earlier AutoQuery works by auto-generating ServiceStack Services for each Request DTO marked with `IQueryDb` unless a custom implementation has been defined for that Query. It's also possible to change the base class for the generated services so that all queries execute your custom implementation instead.

To do this, create a custom Service that inherits from `AutoQueryServiceBase` and overrides both `Exec` methods with your own implementation, e.g:

```csharp
public abstract class MyAutoQueryServiceBase : AutoQueryServiceBase
{
    public override object Exec<From>(IQueryDb<From> dto)
    {
        var q = AutoQuery.CreateQuery(dto, Request.GetRequestParams(), base.Request);
        return AutoQuery.Execute(dto, q, base.Request);
    }

    public override object Exec<From, Into>(IQueryDb<From, Into> dto)
    {
        var q = AutoQuery.CreateQuery(dto, Request.GetRequestParams(), base.Request);
        return AutoQuery.Execute(dto, q, base.Request);
    }
}
```

Then tell AutoQuery to use your base class instead, e.g:

```csharp
Plugins.Add(new AutoQueryFeature { 
    AutoQueryServiceBaseType = typeof(MyAutoQueryServiceBase)
});
```

Which will now get AutoQuery to execute your implementations instead.

## Exclude AutoQuery Collections from being initialized

The default configuration for all languages supported in
[Add ServiceStack Reference](/add-servicestack-reference) 
is to 
[InitializeCollections](/csharp-add-servicestack-reference#initializecollections)
which allows for a nicer client API in which clients can assume Request DTO's have their collections 
initialized allowing them to use the shorthand collection initializer syntax, e.g:

```csharp
var response = client.Get(new SearchQuestions { 
    Tags = { "redis", "ormlite" }
});
```

## AutoQuery CRUD Batch Requests

All AutoQuery CRUD operations support auto batch implementations which will by default execute all AutoQuery CRUD Requests within a DB transaction.

By default it will generate AutoBatch implementations for all CRUD operations and can be changed to only generate implementations for specific CRUD operations by changing:

```csharp
Plugins.Add(new AutoQueryFeature {
    GenerateAutoBatchImplementationsFor = new() { AutoCrudOperation.Create }
});
```

It also wont generate implementations for custom AutoBatch implementations, e.g. you can add a custom implementation that does what the generated implementation would've done and execute using the same DB Connection and Transaction with:

```csharp
public class CustomAutoQueryServices(IAutoQueryDb autoQuery) : Service
{
    public object Any(CreateItem[] requests)
    {
        using var db = autoQuery.GetDb<Item>(Request);
        using var dbTrans = db.OpenTransaction();

        var results = new List<object>();
        foreach (var request in requests)
        {
            var response = await autoQuery.CreateAsync(request, Request, db);
            results.Add(response);
        }

        dbTrans.Commit();
        return results;            
    }
}
```

As AutoQuery Services are normal ServiceStack Services they can re-use the existing Service Client support for [Auto Batched Requests](/auto-batched-requests), e.g:

```csharp
var client = new JsonApiClient(BaseUrl);
var response = client.SendAll(new CreateItem[] { ... });
```
