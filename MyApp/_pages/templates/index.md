ServiceStack accelerates .NET development with battle-tested templates for building modern applications - from high-performance Web APIs and backend services to full-stack web apps, microservices, and cloud-native solutions. Whether you're building a Jamstack site, a Blazor application, or a serverless API, ServiceStack provides the foundation to ship faster.

:::sh
npx create-net ls
:::

Where it will display all repositories in [.NET 10](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates) GitHub Organization:

:::{class="table table-striped w-full"}

::include web-new-netcore.md::

:::

#### Usage

```bash
$ npx create-net `<template>` `<name>`
```

For example to create a new **Next.js statically generated React App**, run:

:::sh
npx create-net next-static ProjectName
:::

[Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/what-is-jamstack) (**J**avaScript, **A**PIs, and **M**arkup) is a modern architecture pattern to build fast, secure and easy to scale web applications where pre-rendering content, enhancing with JavaScript and leveraging CDN static hosting results in a highly productive, flexible and performant system that takes advantage of CDN edge caches to deliver **greater performance** & efficiency at **lower cost**. 

### Jamstack Benefits

It's quickly becoming the preferred architecture for modern web apps with 
[benefits](https://jamstack.org/why-jamstack/) extending beyond performance to improved: 

 - **Security** from a reduced attack surface from hosting read-only static resources and requiring fewer App Servers
 - **Scale** with non-essential load removed from App Servers to CDN's architecture capable of incredible scale & load capacity
 - **Maintainability** resulting from reduced hosting complexity and the clean decoupling of UI and server logic
 - **Portability** with your static UI assets being easily capable from being deployed and generically hosted from any CDN or web server
 - **Developer Experience** with major JavaScript Frameworks embracing Jamstack in their dev model, libraries & tooling  

Ultimately, it's hosting your App's pre-rendered static UI assets on Content Delivery Network (CDN) edge caches close to users locations that's primarily responsible for its lightning performance.

An updated list of available Jamstack project templates is also at https://jamstacks.net (built with Razor SSG)

### Blazor WebAssembly

The [Blazor WebAssembly (WASM)](/templates/blazor-bootstrap) template offers a pure end-to-end integrated C# solution to building a high performance web application with [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) and ServiceStack. Due to the integrated dev model we've been able to achieve in Blazor it's become **our preferred technology** to use to develop **Line of Business Apps** since it's the only C# Razor solution adopting our preferred [API First Development](/api-first-development) model with Web UIs reusing the same well-defined APIs as Mobile and Desktop Apps.

### Razor SSG

The [razor-ssg](https://razor-ssg.web-templates.io/posts/razor-ssg) ServiceStack template leverages the power of .NET Razor to provide seamless static site generation (SSG) capabilities. It's perfect for building content-rich applications like product websites, blogs, portfolios, and more. 

This template streamlines the development process while offering versatility in customizing and extending your project. With GitHub Codespaces integration, you can develop, test, and manage your application all within your browser, eliminating the need for a dedicated development environment and expediting your workflow.

### Next.js

For those preferring working with **React**, there's a clear choice in Nextjs.org - currently the flagship & [most popular Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/generators/) framework backed by the folks over at [Vercel](https://vercel.com), where it enjoys deep engineering talent committed to maintaining and continually improving it, so you can be confident in the longevity of the technology and the React framework maintained by [Meta](https://meta.com) (Facebook).

### Vite

Vite is being [built for speed](https://vitejs.dev/guide/why.html) in the modern era and takes advantage of modern browser features like native ES modules support to remove bundling entirely during development and adopts performance leading technologies like [esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild) to pre-bundle dependencies and [transpile TypeScript](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#typescript) which is able to do **20-30x** faster than TypeScript's own `tsc` compiler.

Ultimately its architectural choices allows Vite to deliver Lightning Fast **Hot Module Reload** (HMR) to remain at the developer-experience forefront of modern web development serving a [growing ecosystem](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) of frameworks with a rich typed suite of [Universal Plugins](https://vitejs.dev/plugins/).

### Webpack-powered Single Page App Templates

All [ServiceStack Single Page App templates](/templates/single-page-apps) are powered by [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) which handles the development, testing and production builds of your Web App. See the [Webpack Template Docs](/templates/single-page-apps) for an overview for how to utilize the templates features.

## Example Projects

The Example projects below contain a working demo including further documentation about each of their templates they were built with:

### TypeScript React Template

[TypeScript React Template](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/typescript-react-template/) incorporates today's best-in-class 
technologies for developing rich, complex JavaScript Apps within VS.NET and encapsulated within ServiceStack's new
[TypeScript React Template](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/typescript-react-template/)
providing an instant integrated client and .NET server solution where you'll be immediately productive 
out-of-the-box whilst enabling an optimal iterative development experience with pre-configured Gulp tasks 
that takes care of effortlessly packaging, bundling and deploying your next App. 

### React Desktop Apps

[React Desktop Apps](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/ReactDesktopApps) take advantage of the adaptability, navigation and deep-linking benefits of a Web-based UI, the productivity and responsiveness of the 
[React framework](https://facebook.github.io/react/),
the performance, rich features and functionality contained in 
[ServiceStack](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki) and the .NET Framework combined with the native experience and OS Integration possible from a Native Desktop App - all within a single VS .NET template!

### React App Template

The [ReactJS App Template](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/ReactChat) enables an optimal iterative dev experience for creating optimized Single Page React.js Apps. It shares the same approach for developing modern Single Page Apps in VS.NET as the [AngularJS App Template](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStackVS/blob/master/docs/angular-spa.md) by leveraging the node.js ecosystem for managing all aspects of Client App development and using the best-in-class libraries.

### AngularJS App Template

The [AngularJS App](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStackVS/blob/master/docs/angular-spa.md) template in [ServiceStackVS](/create-your-first-webservice) provides a modern opinionated web technology stack for developing rich Single Page Apps with [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org) and ServiceStack.

### [Integrated HTML, CSS and JavaScript Minifiers](/html-css-and-javascript-minification)

For normal server-generated websites that don't leverage Webpack to bundle their outputs you can take advantage of ServiceStack's integrated and non-invasive minification features to effortlessly enable [HTML, CSS and JavaScript minification to your existing Website](/html-css-and-javascript-minification).
