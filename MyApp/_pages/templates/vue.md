## .NET Vue Templates with Static Exports

All Vue SPA Templates use **static exports** where at deployment a production build of the Node App is generated and published together with the .NET App in its `/wwwroot` folder, utilizing static file serving to render its UI:

### Hybrid Development Approach

- ASP.NET Core proxies requests to Vite dev server (running on port 5173)
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR) support for instant UI updates
- WebSocket proxying for Vite HMR functionality

### Seamless fusion of .NET APIs, Razor Pages and Vue UIs

A benefit of this architecture of the .NET App handling all Requests and only proxying unknown requests to the Node server is that it enables a seamless fusion of .NET Razor Pages and Vue UIs. As many customers have customized Identity Auth flows we've included the 
[Tailwind Identity Auth Razor Pages](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/vue-static/tree/main/MyApp/Areas/Identity/Pages) from the [razor](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/razor) template into all new .NET Vue Templates.

This ability to seamlessly integrate Vue components within Razor Pages enables a gradual migration strategy, allowing teams to incrementally modernize legacy ASP.NET websites by progressively replacing individual pages or sections with Vue UIs without requiring a complete rewrite or disrupting existing functionality.

## AI-First Development Future

AI can now generate complete, production-ready UI code enabling an entirely new development workflow where developers iteratively guide AI agents to implement features through natural language instructions, where features can be iteratively prototyped, refined and improved within seconds instead of hours.

This AI-first approach is rapidly maturing, with tools like [Cursor](https://cursor.com), [Claude Code](https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code), and [Codex](https://chatgpt.com/features/codex/) becoming the preferred platforms for this new paradigm with new tools designed to get maximum effectiveness of AI models with sophisticated planning tools, focused models optimized for code generation and edits and agentic workflows that's able to solidifying each new feature iteration with tests, along with detailed documentation, planning, migrations and usage guides.

## How ServiceStack Excels in AI-First Development

Context is king when developing with AI models. The better the context, the higher the quality of generated code and ServiceStack's architecture is uniquely suited for AI-assisted development:

### Declarative Typed APIs

All ServiceStack APIs follow a flat, declarative structure—The contract is explicit and consistent and LLMs don't need to guess what APIs accept or return.

### End-to-End Type Safety

Context quality directly impacts generated code quality. ServiceStack's TypeScript integration provides complete static analysis of what APIs accept, return, and how to bind responses—giving AI models the full context they need.
The static analysis feedback also directs models to identify and correct any errors in the generated code.

### Zero-Ambiguity Integration

AI models thrive on consistency. ServiceStack removes guesswork with a single pattern for all API calls:
- One generic `JsonServiceClient` for all APIs
- Consistent methods used to send all requests
- Consistent Typed Request DTO → Response DTO flow
- Uniform error handling

### TypeScript

Whilst TypeScript is often excluded in one-prompt solutions catering to non-developers, it's still a critical part of the AI development workflow. It provides a type system that helps AI models generate more accurate and maintainable code and TypeScript's static analysis also helps identify errors in the generated code which AI Models have have become really good at correcting—as such it's an integral part in all our SPA templates.

### Intuitive Project Structure

ServiceStack's [physical project structure](/physical-project-structure) provides clear separation of concerns, with the entire API surface area contained in [the ServiceModel project](/physical-project-structure#servicemodel-project)—making codebases easy for AI models to navigate and understand.

### Minimal Code Surface

Less code means fewer opportunities for errors. ServiceStack's high-productivity features minimize the code AI needs to generate:

- **[AutoQuery APIs](/autoquery/rdbms)** - Flexible, queryable APIs defined with just a Request DTO
- **[AutoQueryGrid Component](/vue/autoquerygrid)** - Complete CRUD UIs in 1 line of code
- **[Auto Form Components](/vue/autoform)** - Beautiful, validation-bound forms in 1 line of code

These components are ideal for rapidly building backend management interfaces, freeing developers to focus on differentiating customer-facing features.

## ASP.NET Core Vue SPA Template 

The [Vue and ASP.NET Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/javascript/tutorial-asp-net-core-with-vue) 
template provides a seamless starting solution which runs both the .NET API backend and Vite Vue frontend during development.

It's a modern template capturing the best Vue has to offer, configured with Vite's fast HMR (Hot Module Reload) and TypeScript support - 
it allows App's to be developed with Vue's typed [Single File Components](https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/sfc.html) enabling
both a productive development experience and an optimal high-performance production build at runtime.

### End-to-end Typed APIs

Instead of hand-rolled types and Stringly Typed API calls, it utilizes server 
[generated TypeScript DTOs](https://docs.servicestack.net/typescript-add-servicestack-reference)
with a generic JsonServiceClient to enable end-to-end Typed APIs:

```ts
import { ref, onMounted } from 'vue'
import { ApiResult } from "@servicestack/client"
import { useClient } from "@servicestack/vue"
import { GetWeatherForecast } from "@/dtos"

const client = useClient()
const api = ref(new ApiResult())

onMounted(async () => {
    api.value = await client.api(new GetWeatherForecast())
})
```

This benefits in less code to maintain, immediate static typing analysis to ensure correct usage of APIs and valuable 
feedback when APIs are changed, that's easily updated with a single command:

:::sh
npm run dtos
:::

### High Productivity Vue Components

With access to the [ServiceStack Vue Components](https://docs.servicestack.net/vue/) library there's also less code to 
maintain in the UI, where you can render a beautiful tailwind styled DataGrid with just:

```html
<DataGrid :items="api.response" />
```

### Bookings CRUD Pages

Or create a complete CRUD interface with just:

```html
<AutoQueryGrid type="Booking" />
```

The [Bookings CRUD example](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/vue-spa/blob/main/MyApp.Client/src/pages/bookings-auto.vue) shows how you can rapidly develop beautiful responsive, customized CRUD UIs with minimal effort using [AutoQuery APIs](https://docs.servicestack.net/autoquery/), [AutoForms](https://docs.servicestack.net/autoform) & [AutoQueryGrid](https://blazor-gallery.servicestack.net/gallery/autoquerygrid) Vue Components.

## ServiceStack Vue SPA Features

Other high-productivity features available in the ServiceStack Vue SPA template include:

### Integrated Identity Auth

Pre-configured with ASP.NET Core Identity Auth, including Sign In and Custom Registration APIs and
UI Pages which can be customized as needed, examples of Role-based security as well as a turn key solution for
Integrating Identity Auth Registration workflow with your [SMTP Provider](https://docs.servicestack.net/auth/identity-auth#smtp-iemailsender)

## Development Workflow

### 1. Start Development

:::sh
dotnet watch
:::

This automatically starts both .NET and Vite dev servers.

### 2. Generate TypeScript DTOs

After modifying C# service models, regenerate TypeScript dtos.ts in `MyApp` or `MyApp.Client` with:

:::sh
npm run dtos
:::

### 3. Database Migrations

**OrmLite and Entity Framework:**

:::sh
npm run migrate
:::

**OrmLite (for application data):**

Create migration classes in `MyApp/Migrations/` following the pattern in `Migration1000.cs`.

### 4. Testing

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd MyApp.Client
npm run test        # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:ui     # Run tests with UI
npm run test:run    # Run tests once
```
