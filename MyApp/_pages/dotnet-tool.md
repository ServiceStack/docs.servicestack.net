title: ServiceStack's .NET Core Utility Belt
---

Our `x` and `app` dotnet tools are a versatile invaluable companion for all ServiceStack developers where it's 
jam packed with functionality to power a number of exciting scenarios where it serves as a [Sharp App](https://sharpscript.net/docs/sharp-apps) 
delivery platform where they can be run as a .NET Core Windows Desktop App with `app` or as a cross-platform Web App launcher using `web` and we've already how it's now a [`#Script` runner](https://sharpscript.net/docs/sharp-scripts) with `x run` and into a 
[Live `#Script` playground](https://sharpscript.net/docs/sharp-scripts#live-script-with-web-watch) with `x watch`.

These tools contains all the functionality ServiceStack Developers or API consumers need that can be used 
[Create ServiceStack projects](/dotnet-new), run [Gist Desktop Apps](https://sharpscript.net/sharp-apps/gist-desktop-apps) 
or generate typed endpoints for consuming ServiceStack Services by either
[Add/Update ServiceStack References](/add-servicestack-reference) or by generating [gRPC client proxies](/grpc#grpc-clients).

## Install

To access available features, install with:

:::sh
dotnet tool install --global x 
:::

### Update

Or if you had a previous version installed, update with:

:::sh
dotnet tool update -g x
:::

::: info
Both `x` and `app` have equivalent base functionality, whilst `app` has superset [Windows-only Desktop features](/netcore-windows-desktop)
:::

::: info
To update and download Add ServiceStack Reference dtos without .NET see [npx get-dtos](/npx-get-dtos)

### Add/Update ServiceStack References

This shows us we can Add a ServiceStack Reference with `x <lang> <baseurl>` which will let us create a TypeScript Reference 
to the new [World Validation](/world-validation) App using its `ts` file extension alias:


:::sh
x ts http://validation.web-app.io
:::

Output:
```
Saved to: dtos.ts
```

Or create a C# ServiceStack Reference with:

:::sh
x cs http://validation.web-app.io
:::

Output:
```
Saved to: dtos.cs
```

To update run `x <lang>` which will recursively update all existing ServiceStack References:

:::sh
x ts
:::

Output:
```
Updated: dtos.ts
```

### Integrate with Visual Studio

You can also easily integrate this within your VS.NET dev workflows by [adding it as an External Tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/managing-external-tools?view=vs-2019) in the **External Tools** dialog box by choosing `Tools > External Tools`:

![](/img/pages/servicestack-reference/tool-ts-reference.png)

|  ||
|-|-|
| Title             | Update TypeScript &Reference |
| Command           | web.exe |
| Arguments         | ts |
| Initial directory | $(ProjectDir) |
|  ||

Which will then let you update all your `*dtos.ts` TypeScript References in your project by clicking on `Tools > Update TypeScript Reference` 
or using the `ALT+T R` keyboard shortcut.

If you wanted to Update your `*dtos.cs` **C# ServiceStack References** instead, just change Arguments to `cs`:

![](/img/pages/servicestack-reference/tool-cs-reference.png)

|  ||
|-|-|
| **Title**             | Update C# &Reference |
| **Command**           | web.exe |
| **Arguments**         | cs |
| **Initial directory** | $(ProjectDir) |
|  ||

Refer to the [x usage output](#usage) above for the arguments or aliases for all other supported languages.

### Integrate with Rider

Just like with VS.NET above you can [add an External Tool](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/rider/Settings_Tools_External_Tools.html) 
in [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) by opening the Settings dialog with `CTRL+ALT+S` then searching for `external tools` 
under the **Tools** category:

![](/img/pages/servicestack-reference/rider-tool-ts-reference.png)

|  ||
|-|-|
| **Name**              | Update TypeScript Reference |
| **Command**           | web.exe |
| **Arguments**         | ts |
| **Working directory** | $FileParentDir$ |
|  ||

Now you can update your `*dtos.ts` TypeScript References in your project by clicking on `External Tools > Update TypeScript Reference`
in the right-click context menu:

![](/img/pages/servicestack-reference/rider-tool-ts-reference-run.png)

If you're updating references frequently you can save time by [assigning it a keyboard shortcut](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/rider/Configuring_Keyboard_and_Mouse_Shortcuts.html).

### Create new Project Templates

See [x new](/web-new) for available Project Templates you can create with:

:::sh
x new
:::

### Mix Features into existing ASP.NET Core Apps

The `x` dotnet tool is a versatile utility belt packed with a number of features to simplify discovering, installing, running and deploying 
.NET Core Apps. You can view the full list of supported commands by running `x ?`, e.g. another useful command is using [`x mix`](/mix-tool)
for generating pre-set templates:

```
x mix                     Show available gists to mixin         (Alias '+')
x mix <name>              Write gist files locally, e.g:        (Alias +init)
x mix init                Create empty .NET Core ServiceStack App
x mix [tag]               Search available gists
x gist <gist-id>          Write all Gist text files to current directory
```

View available gists with:

:::sh
x mix
:::

Where you can use `x mix nginx` to generate a common nginx template configuration for reverse proxying .NET Core Apps, making configuring 
[Linux deployment servers for your .NET Core Apps](/netcore-deploy-rsync) less tedious. 

In addition to the pre-set templates, you can create your own [public GitHub gist](https://gist.github.com) with any number of different files customized 
for your Environment that anyone can write to their current directory with **the gist id** or **gist URL**:

:::sh
`x gist <gist-id>`
:::

### Patch JSON files

The `x` dotnet tool also includes a number of utilities for patching JSON files, e.g. you can use `x patch` to patch a JSON file with a [JSON Patch](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/web-api/jsonpatch?view=aspnetcore-7.0).

The `json.patch` file supports the following JSON Patch operations:

| Operation | Notes                                                                              |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| add       | Add a property or array element. For existing property: set value.                 |
| remove    | Remove a property or array element.                                                |
| replace   | Same as remove followed by add at same location.                                   |
| move      | Same as remove from source followed by add to destination using value from source. |
| copy      | Same as add to destination using value from source.                                |
| test      | Return success status code if value at path = provided value.                      |

For example, we could have the following `original.json` file:

```json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "SmtpConfig": {}
}
```

We need to fill this `smtp` object with settings such as username, password, host, port, and more. To automate filling these values, we can use the ServiceStack `x` tool to apply a `json.patch`. The `json.patch` file to accomplish this would look something like:

```json
[
  {
    "op": "add",
    "path": "/SmtpConfig",
    "value": {
      "UserName": "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID",
      "Password": "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY",
      "Host": "email-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com",
      "Port": 587,
      "FromName": "From Name",
      "FromEmail": "email@address.com",
      "Bcc": "bcc email address"
    }
  }
]
```

Once this patch is applied, our `appsettings.json` transforms into:

```json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "SmtpConfig": {
    "UserName": "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID",
    "Password": "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY",
    "Host": "email-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com",
    "Port": 587,
    "From": "email address",
    "FromName": "From Name",
    "Bcc": "bcc email address"
  }
}
```

You can apply this patch using the `x` tool's `patch` command:

```bash
x patch appsettings.json.patch
```

This expects both the `appsettings.json.patch` and `appsettings.json` files to be local. Optionally, you can specify both files if their names differ.

```bash
x patch changes.json.patch appsettings.json
```

### Lisp REPL

Lisp's dynamism and extensibility makes it particularly well suited for explanatory programming whose access via a REPL is available 
`x`, `web` and `app` dotnet tools.

The quick demo below shows the kind of exploratory programming available where you can query the `scriptMethods` available, 
query an objects `props`, query the Lisp interpreter's global `symbols` table containing all its global state including all 
defined lisp functions, macros and variables:

:::

### Annotated REPL Walk through

Here's an annotated version of the demo below which explains what each of the different expressions is doing.

Just like [Sharp Scripts](https://sharpscript.net/docs/sharp-scripts) and [Sharp Apps](https://sharpscript.net/docs/sharp-apps) the Lisp REPL runs within the 
[#Script Pages](https://sharpscript.net/docs/script-pages) ScriptContext [sandbox](https://sharpscript.net/docs/sandbox) that when run from a Sharp App folder, 
starts a .NET Core App Server that simulates a fully configured .NET Core App. 
In this case it's running in the [redis Sharp App](https://github.com/sharp-apps/redis) directory where it was able to access its static web assets
as well as its redis-server connection configured in its [app.settings](https://github.com/sharp-apps/redis/blob/master/app.settings).

```lisp
; quick lisp test!
(+ 1 2 3)

; display the key names of all redis keys starting with 'urn:'
(joinln (map :id (redisSearchKeys "urn:*")))

; find out the redis-server data type of the 'urn:tags' key
(redisCall "TYPE urn:tags")

; view all tags in the 'urn:tags' sorted set
(redisCall "ZRANGE urn:tags 0 -1")

; view the string contents of the 'urn:question:1' key

; extract the 2nd tag of question 1
(:1 (:Tags (parseJson (redisCall "GET urn:question:1"))))

; clear the Console screen
clear

; exit the Lisp REPL
quit
```

#### Enable features and access resources with app.settings

You can configure the Lisp REPL with any of the resources and features that [Sharp Apps](https://sharpscript.net/docs/sharp-apps) and 
[Gist Desktop Apps](https://sharpscript.net/docs/gist-desktop-apps) have access to, by creating a plain text `app.settings` file with all the 
features and resources you want the Lisp REPL to have access to, e.g. this [Pure Cloud App app.settings](https://sharpscript.net/docs/sharp-apps#pure-cloud-apps)
allows the Lisp REPL to use [Database Scripts](https://sharpscript.net/docs/db-scripts) against a AWS PostgreSQL RDS server and query remote 
[S3 Virtual Files](/virtual-file-system) using [Virtual File System APIs](https://sharpscript.net/docs/protected-scripts#virtual-file-system-apis):

```
# Note: values prefixed with '$' are resolved from Environment Variables
name AWS S3 PostgreSQL Web App
db postgres
db.connection $AWS_RDS_POSTGRES
files s3
files.config {AccessKey:$AWS_S3_ACCESS_KEY,SecretKey:$AWS_S3_SECRET_KEY,Region:us-east-1,Bucket:rockwind}
```

See the [plugins app.settings](https://sharpscript.net/docs/sharp-apps#registering-servicestack-plugins) for examples of how to load and configure 
[ServiceStack Plugins](/plugins).
