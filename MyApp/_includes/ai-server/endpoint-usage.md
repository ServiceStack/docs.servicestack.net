These endpoints are used in a similar way to other AI Server endpoints where you can provide:
 - `RefId` - provide a unique identifier to track requests
 - `Tag` - categorize like requests under a common group

In addition **Queue** requests can provide:
 - `ReplyTo` - URL to send a POST request to when the request is complete
