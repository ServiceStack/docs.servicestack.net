The new **Blazor Vue** template is ideal for building Fast, SEO-friendly, 100% statically rendered Blazor Web Apps where 
all its dynamic functionally uses Vue.js to progressively enhance Blazor's statically rendered content - eliminating Blazor's 
current limitations of being able to use Blazor SSR to develop an entire App without any of Blazor Interactivity downsides.

The new [blazor-vue](https://servicestack.net/posts/net8-best-blazor) template implements all the features of the [blazor](https://servicestack.net/posts/net8-blazor-template) 
template but reimplements all its interactive features with **Vue.js** to and the 
[Vue Components library](https://docs.servicestack.net/vue/), with both templates combining the latest advancements in 
Blazor .NET 8 with **Tailwind CSS** styling for creating beautiful Responsive Websites with support for Dark Mode.
